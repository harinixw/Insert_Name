However, Last Word on Sports writer David Latham believes the Bills could pursue Carolina Panthers wide receiver Adam Thielen. TAMPA, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 29: Adam Thielen #19 of the Carolina Panthers catches a pass during the fourth quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium on December 29, 2024 in Tampa, Florida....

More Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images "The Buffalo Bills have the arguably the game's best quarterback in Josh Allen, and his presence alone ensures this team will have an elite offense," wrote Latham. "However, they could use more security at the wide receiver position. The jury is still out on second-round pick Keon Coleman, and while slot receiver Khalil Shakir is a solid player, he shouldn't be the only proven threat on the roster. Adam Thielen may not be a 1,300-yard player at this stage in his career, but he's more reliable than free agent journeyman Joshua Palmer." Coleman was a late bloomer last season with Allen, so the Bills are hopeful that duo can pick up right where it left off. However, the talent behind Coleman is questionable at best and terrible at worst. Adding Thielen as a WR2 makes all the sense in the world for a team like the Bills. Thielen posted 1,000 receiving yards just two years ago, and while he is now 35 years old, he still has a little left in the tank. The Bills would have to get creative if they acquired Thielen. He has a cap hit of $10.1 million this season, and Buffalo is already almost $2 million over the cap. It's not an impossible task, but general manager Brandon Beane would have his work cut out for him.
