The former New York Giants quarterback is currently going head-to-head with Anthony Richardson. Heading into their Thursday night preseason battle against the Baltimore Ravens, the Colts made it clear that Richardson would get the nod to start. That wasn't the team declaring that Jones will enter the regular season as his backup. Instead, it was the Colts giving Richardson a chance to show how he looks with the starters again, before handing the keys over to Jones for the second game. The plan was to flip-flop them for the first two weeks. Then, move forward accordingly. Thursday's outing didn't go as planned for Richardson. The often-injured quarterback ran into a similar issue, as he dislocated his right pinkie finger. Jones ended up getting a bulk of the opportunities in the early stages of the game. On Friday, there was a critical update regarding Richardson's injury. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Richardson could return to practice as soon as Saturday. Therefore, he could be in line to suit up and play in Indianapolis' second matchup of the preseason.

More Patrick Smith/Getty Images With Richardson's early injury shaking up the state of the battle, it's unclear how the Colts will approach the second week of the preseason. On Saturday, August 16, the Colts will take on the Green Bay Packers at home. Even if Jones doesn't get the start, he'll get an opportunity to build on his case to become the full-time starter. With the Giants, Jones appeared in 70 games. He threw for 14,582 yards, 70 touchdowns, and 47 interceptions. As a starter, he notched a 24-44-1 record from 2019 to 2024. After seeing the field for 10 games in 2024, Jones' struggles led the Giants to bench him for a fresh start. The benching eventually led to a split between Jones and the Giants, which placed him on a path to land on the Minnesota Vikings and then the Colts. Meanwhile, Richardson has 15 games under his belt across two years. The young quarterback has produced 2,391 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions since 2023. In 15 starts, Richardson holds an 8-7 record. For more New York Giants and NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.
