FanDuel Promo Code for NFL Preseason FanDuel Promo Code No Code Required New User Offer Risk $5, Receive $150 in Bonus Bets With a Win In-App Promos 25% Parlay Profit Boost on Any Sport, Daily Boosts, etc. Terms and Conditions New Customers ‚Äì 21+ in Eligible States Bonus Last Verified On Aug. 8, 2025 Information Confirmed By Newsweek The important caveat to this offer is that you must win your initial $5 bet to get the $150 in bonus bets. Just make sure that you bet on a market that you believe is likely to settle as a win. It would be wise to look at a wide variety of betting markets available across the FanDuel Sportsbook app. You could bet on one of the NFL preseason games. However, it is hard to predict the outcome of those. With Shedeur Sanders starting for the Browns and making his professional debut, there are plenty of prop markets related to how he will perform. Maybe you could bet on his first pass to be a completion, or for him to have one or more passing touchdowns. If you win the $150 in bonus bets, you will have one week to put them to use before they expire from your account.

Odds, Preview For Friday NFL Preseason Games The bulk of the Week 1 preseason games will take place on Saturday, but Friday's matchups bring some intrigue. Sanders' Browns debut will garner a lot of attention, no matter how it goes. We likely will not see much, if any starters in tonight's matchups, but this will be the first time we see many top 2025 draft picks take the field. Let's look at the odds below for tonight's games at FanDuel Sportsbook: Browns: +6.5 (-115) / +240 / O32.5 (-105) Panthers: -6.5 (-105) / -290 / U32.5 (-115) Lions: -3.5 (-115) / -200 / O32.5 (-120) Falcons: +3.5 (-105) / +170 / U32.5 (+100) Commanders: +6.5 (-110) / +220 / O34.5 (-110) Patriots: -6.5 (-110) / -270 / U34.5 (-110) Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.
