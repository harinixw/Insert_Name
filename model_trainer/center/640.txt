Tsunoda outperformed most of his teammates at Racing Bulls in the last two years, which resulted in a promotion to Red Bull. The team decided to swap him with Lawson after it was disappointed with the Kiwi driver's performances in the first two race weekends of the season. The decision resulted in Lawson's demotion. However, like other teammates of Max Verstappen, Tsunoda is struggling to adapt to Red Bull's challenger, the RB21, which is reportedly suited to the four-time world champion's driving style. As a result, Tsunoda's performance was immediately affected upon his promotion after the Chinese Grand Prix. Tsunoda worked extensively with Mekies at Racing Bulls. Ahead of the summer break of the 2024 season, he had secured 22 points. However, that tally for 2025 stands at just 10 points.

Speaking during the Hungarian GP weekend, where Tsunoda finished in P17, Mekies told Sky Sports F1: "The priority is to give Yuki what he needs to perform. That's where, with regards to the second seat, that's where the priority is. It's what the team is concentrated on. "They have been trying that for a number of races now. We are trying to find ways together to make a further step. You know, Spa was very positive, certainly from that perspective. "Here it's a bit of a tricky weekend overall, so it's probably a bit more difficult to judge. But there is no reason why Yuki's performance cannot be what we have seen in the past. And that's what we are concentrated on right now." Tsunoda's Red Bull contract expires at the end of 2025, and with his future being uncertain, he has just 10 races to prove his racing prowess. Offering a realistic picture of the RB21, the 25-year-old driver hinted that it could take an entire season for him to get used to the car. He said: "Is it true that in terms of confidence, when the condition changes every session, maybe I'm taking a little bit more time compared to where I used to have at VCARB where for example, I knew exactly how the car was going to drive in each set-up, I can go flat out from the first push. "But maybe in the Red Bull, I had to build up, which for me is the right approach. I don't think it's a wrong approach, but just takes a bit of time. I don't know if it's going to take a whole season or not, but at least it's positive that I'm going in the right direction." Is This Article Trustworthy? Is This Article Trustworthy?
