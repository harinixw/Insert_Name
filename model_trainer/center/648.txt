An active shooter alert was issued around 5 p.m. Friday. The Atlanta Police Department (APD) said on X around 6:45 p.m. that the incident involved a single shooter and that there was no ongoing threat to the campus. No civilians were injured. The department asked for people to avoid the area, as the scene was still active. Newsweek reached out to Emory University via email on Friday for additional information. Why It Matters There have been several shootings this year, including on a college campus, when fatal gunfire broke out in April at Florida State University. What To Know In a Friday night news conference, APD Chief Darin Schierbaum told reporters that the shooter was found on the second floor of the CVS on the Emory University campus, with a gunshot wound. It was unknown at the time if it was self-inflicted. When asked about reports that the shooter believed he may be sick due to the COVID vaccine, Schierbaum said he could not confirm any motive at the time.

Jeff Amy/AP A law enforcement official on Friday exits the hospital of Emory University in Atlanta. Mike Stewart/AP "We are in the early stages of the investigation," he said, adding that police had the "same questions you have" about the shooter's motivations. Witnesses told CNN they had seen a man dressed in black, point a rifle at the CDC center on Friday afternoon and heard multiple gunshots. The alert from Emory University, issued at 5 p.m., warned of an "active shooter" at the campus CVS and urged everyone nearby to "RUN, HIDE, FIGHT. Avoid the area." Emory Hospital and the university went into lockdown. Witness Randy Gould told CNN on Friday that he was leaving the hospital, with his recently discharged father in a wheelchair, when he saw doctors and nurses running toward them, "screaming there's an active shooter." In an update to its X account at 5:59 p.m. ET, the university wrote, "UPDATE: Continue to shelter in place, law enforcement on scene." In a subsequent update at 6:27 p.m. ET on X, the school wrote that the "police emergency continues. Remain in place. Updates to follow." The Associated Press (AP) reports CDC employees said that windows in several buildings were sprayed with bullets.
