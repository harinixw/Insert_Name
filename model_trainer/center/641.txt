Inconsistencies may occur. ‚úñ A woman named Valerie, who was originally unsure about bringing home a puppy, realized the dog made the decision easier for her after they locked eyes during her visit to a breeder. Valerie told Newsweek via TikTok that she passed on the idea of bringing home a golden retriever puppy. But by the time she changed her mind, all the pups on the waitlist had been taken by other people. With the flight already booked to Utah, she decided to go anyway. She wanted to meet the breeder and see how they raised the puppies. As fate would have it, something fell through, and suddenly one pup became available, she said. If that wasn't enough of a sign, Valerie shared in an Instagram video on May 22 under the account @beaux.and.oatie, how the only available puppy, now named Beaux, knew they were meant to be together. He "chose" her with one simple look. During her visit with the puppies, many stood up against the pen, wagging their tails. But soon enough, exhaustion took over and they all fell asleep, except for Beaux. His head tilted up against the pen, eyes locked in with hers. He knew this was his human. "It truly felt like he chose us," she said. The Instagram video's caption reads: "When you know, you know."

One user wrote: "He was born to be with you guys. He seriously STOOD out." A second commented: "Meant for each other." And a third added: "Omg little sweet beaux. He just knew." A few users shared how their pups stood out to them, with one having a "lovely little smile," and another resting its head on the owner's lap. But not everyone had similar experiences. Some users wrote that they did the opposite and took a chance on the shy puppies who sat in the corner. Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?
