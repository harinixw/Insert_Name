Shedeur Sanders received his first start in the NFL. Due to both Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel nursing injuries, Sanders not only received the start, but is expected to play quite a few snaps throughout the game. Tyler Huntley will replace him at some point. In the first quarter, all eyes were on Sanders. However, another situation stole the show.

Legette, who is a clear lock to make the roster for Carolina, is expected to be a big part of the offense. Last season in his rookie year with the Panthers, he racked up 49 receptions for 497 yards and four touchdowns. Jenkins, on the other hand, is a 31-year-old veteran safety who played the 2024 season with the Seattle Seahawks. He played in 13 games and recorded 53 tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery. Clearly, both teams and both players were amped up for the game. However, their respective coaching staffs will not like seeing them get ejected in the first quarter of the preseason opener.
