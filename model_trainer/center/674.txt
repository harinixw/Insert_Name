Lovell died on Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois, NASA announced in a news release. He is survived by his four children. "NASA sends its condolences to the family of Capt. Jim Lovell, whose life and work inspired millions of people across the decades," acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement. Newsweek has reached out to NASA via email Friday for additional comment. Captain Jim Lovell of the U.S. Navy, pilot of the Gemini 7 space mission, is pictured in December 1965.

Lovell led the Apollo 13 crew during a 1970 in‚Äëflight emergency that forced NASA to abort a planned lunar landing and instead execute a high‚Äëstakes return to Earth. His leadership during that crisis shaped public memory of the Apollo era and had a lasting influence on U.S. spaceflight culture. The Apollo 13 crew did not land on the moon after an oxygen tank in the service module exploded roughly 56 hours into the mission, depriving the spacecraft of electrical power and life‚Äësupport consumables. Flight controllers and the crew used the lunar module as a lifeboat to return safely to Earth. Lovell was the first man to travel to the moon twice. He never did walk on the moon.

Tributes Pour in for the Late Astronaut Lovell's family in a statement posted by NASA on X on Friday: "We are saddened to announce the passing of our beloved father, USN Captain James A. 'Jim' Lovell, a Navy pilot and officer, astronaut, leader, and space explorer. He was 97. We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind." Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, on X Friday: "Grieving the loss of one of my best friends, Jim Lovell. His extraordinary legacy is cemented by many space missions: Gemini VII, Gemini XII, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13. Our mutual respect had no limits. The Gemini XII mission we flew together paved the way for the Apollo missions. Heartfelt condolences to Jim's family. Farewell Jim. You will be missed, my friend. Godspeed!" Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut, posted to X on Friday: "When Jim Lovell heard [President John F.] Kennedy's goal to reach the Moon, he thought it was impossible ‚Äî then he went there twice. He said to be successful, you need to be a person who makes things happen. Jim, you made things happen for our country and humanity. Fair Winds and Following Seas." Actor Andrew McCarthy wrote on X Friday: "Jim Lovell was an absolute legend. Made famous by the film Apollo 13 (he was Tom Hank's character) but also the command module pilot for Apollo 8, imo the most gutsy mission from the history of crewed spaceflight. One of 24 people to ever see Earth like this. Rest well, Jim." Steve Forbes, editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, wrote on X Friday: "So sad to hear. An American hero!" Former NASA Astronaut Mike Massimino on X on Friday: "I am so sad to hear about the passing of my hero Jim Lovell. He was a great role model not only as an astronaut, but also as a person who exemplified a life well lived - both professionally and personally. He will be missed by many, Godspeed my friend."

Marilyn was born in Milwaukee on July 11, 1930, and died in August 2023 at the age of 93. Marilyn and Jim went to high school together and she later enrolled at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., to be closer to him while he was in the United States Naval Academy in Maryland, the Times reports. The family later settled in Houston. Update 8/8/25, 10:32 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information. Is This Article Trustworthy? Is This Article Trustworthy?
