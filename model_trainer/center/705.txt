As things continue to unravel, one analyst sounded off on Jerry Jones for how he's conducted business thus far. Earlier this year, Micah Parsons and Jones reportedly had talks about an extension for the All-Pro linebacker. Despite things almost being worked out at one point, it's slowly evolved into a worst-case scenario for the Cowboys. The front office has had little to no talks with Parsons' agent, resulting in a growing frustration that led to a stunning trade request last week. Although the Cowboys have no plans of moving on from the homegrown star, the end of this saga appears to be nowhere in sight.

He went on a fiery rant about Jones, bashing him for trying to get things done without involving the necessary parties. "You can't say I came to a handshake agreement with a non-negotiating party," Wright said. "Micah is not the negotiating party for Micah Parsons. Jerry is the negotiating party for the Cowboys. It's not his business. It is outrageous to me for Jerry to spring on Micah a contract discussion. They get to wherever it seems okay, and then be like it's done we negotiated. He knows better than that." ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say 'I came to a handshake agreement' with a non-negotiating party.

That said, things with Parsons continue to move towards a point of no return. Earlier this week, it was reported that Parsons and the Cowboys' owner haven't spoken since he voiced his trade request. Since Micah Parsons issued his trade request, he has not spoken to Jerry Jones. https://t.co/ba0m1ixEh9 ‚Äî Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 5, 2025 Despite how things look at the moment, Jones doesn't seem to be worried about Parsons' future in Dallas. When recently talking about the defensive star, he had nothing but good things to say about him while hinting at him still being part of the Cowboys' future. "I think the world of Micah," Jones said after Tuesday's practice, via The Athletic. "He's one of the brightest people I've ever been around. He's very, very talented. Now, how we ultimately meld him in with our future is a challenge. I'm built for it and he's built for it." With the start of the regular season less than a month away, the Cowboys are running out of time to put this situation behind them before the 2025 campaign gets underway.
