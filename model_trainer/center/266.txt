But it was that wedding, with its wave of impeccable fashion moments, that marked a shift: the world didn’t just admire her style, they wanted the blueprint. Now, Richie Grainge is channeling that influence into ownership. Now, she’s stepping into her “Investor Era,” starting with an equity stake in fashion tech platform ShopMy and a role as one of its founding Curators. The move expands her role from setting trends to shaping the very platforms where those trends are discovered, blending her instinct for style with a seat at the business table. It’s a shift that signals more than a career pivot: it’s an evolution. “I wanted to have a real say in the conversation, not just participate in it,” she says. “Investing in ShopMy felt like the natural next step because it’s about building the future of how people interact with style and commerce.” Co-founded in 2020 by Chris Tinsley, Tiffany Lopinsky and Harry Rein, ShopMy has become a performance marketing powerhouse, moving more than $500 million in brand sales through a network of 175,000 vetted creators. Until now, its focus has been on powering brand–creator partnerships behind the scenes: matching brands with creators whose recommendations consistently deliver 5x ROI, and giving those creators a polished digital storefront to share their picks. I spoke with Richie Grainge about what compelled her to invest in ShopMy, as well as Tinsley, Chief Business Development Officer, who shared insights on how the company is rethinking online shopping.

Shoppers can now create “personal boutiques” built from the recommendations of multiple trusted creators, a move that blends editorial curation with community. “We’ve always believed that creators are the new retailers. As ShopMy scaled, we saw that shoppers weren’t just buying from individual creators, they were building trust-based habits around how and where they discover products.” says Tinsley. “Circles takes that behavior and gives consumers a more intentional, community-driven way to shop across multiple tastemakers they already admire.” ShopMy’s launch comes at a critical inflection point for social commerce. Platforms like TikTok Shop have captured attention and sales with lower-priced, impulse-friendly products. Instagram scaled back its dedicated shopping tab in 2023, while LTK recently relaunched its app to lean into video-first discovery. ShopMy is betting on a different play: curation over algorithm. The platform leans into human taste rather than entertainment-driven feeds, offering permanence where most social content disappears within 24 hours. “People are exhausted by choice overload and algorithm manipulation,” says Tinsley. “They want to shop through trusted voices they specifically choose, not faceless recommendation engines.” It’s a timely bet. According to Vogue Business, Goldman Sachs projects the global creator economy will grow to $500 billion by 2027. In today’s creator economy, the winners will be the platforms that can marry measurable ROI with cultural credibility. For Richie Grainge, the appeal was immediate. “ShopMy wanted to create an ecosystem where taste is currency and people can shop in a way that feels personal, not transactional. That was exciting to me,” she says. Tinsley sees her involvement as a validation of ShopMy’s positioning. “Sofia represents exactly what we believe the future of influence looks like. Someone who curates like an editor, builds trust like a peer, and whose taste genuinely drives purchasing decisions,” he says. “Having her as both an investor and founding Curator shows we’re not just building another commerce platform; we’re creating a new category where cultural tastemakers become retail partners.” The decision to invest was personal for Richie Grainge. “After my wedding, I saw how much influence a single moment could have. The way people were searching for pieces, reinterpreting looks, and discovering brands. I thought, if I can generate this kind of movement, I want to be more than a face of the moment. I want ownership in the platforms that make those moments possible.” Richie Grainge approaches it with the same intentionality she brings to her brand collaborations. “Trust is everything. I never share something I wouldn’t buy, wear or use myself. People can tell when it’s authentic. ShopMy is designed for sharing taste, not just pushing product.” Circles also reshapes the creator-audience dynamic, grouping tastemakers into curated sets like “Founders,” “Interior Design Experts,” and “Dear Media Hosts.” Many span multiple categories, giving shoppers a richer, more interconnected view of style, home, and lifestyle recommendations. “The platform turns a follower into a co-shopper,” Tinsley explains. “It’s no longer just about watching what a creator recommends, it’s about participating in a shared curation experience.” While Circles uses AI to recommend adjacent creators through “Taste Profiles,” the goal is to keep the experience human-first. “Taste is contagious,” says Tinsley. “Our AI is designed to feel like a trusted referral, not a random suggestion. The goal isn’t to be everything to everyone; it’s to be indispensable to people who value taste, trust and authentic curation,” he says. Early signals suggest strong traction: according to Tinsley, 60 million shoppers have engaged with creator recommendations on ShopMy in the past 12 months, and more than 3,000 brands have been wishlisted in Circles’ first week, launched just days ago. Tinsley adds: “Of those who make accounts, more than 25% come back daily for more recommendations." For Richie Grainge, this is just the beginning and the goal goes beyond shopping. It’s also about making an impact: “The more women we have in ownership positions, the more the industry changes. If I can open doors for other women - whether they’re curators, designers, or entrepreneurs - that’s the real win.” Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...
