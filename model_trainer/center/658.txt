At the deadline, the front office opted to add heavily to the bullpen while standing pat with the rotation. On the offensive side of things, the Yankees desperately needed to add a third baseman more than anything. They solved this issue by adding Amed Rosario, Jose Caballero, and Ryan McMahon. The Yankees also added platoon outfielder Austin Slater from the Chicago White Sox. Slater played in a few games with the Yankees and went 0-for-7 with four strikeouts before suffering a leg injury that found him on the injured list.

More Jim McIsaac/Getty Images Aaron Boone recently announced that Slater would be out for four to six weeks with a hamstring strain, per Chris Kirschner of The Athletic. Slater wasn't a huge addition for the Yankees. He was added to provide depth and a solid bench bat for Boone's squad, but it doesn't look like he's going to be a piece of the puzzle for the next month or two. Hamstring injuries tend to nag on a lot longer than expected, too. So, Boone's projection of four to six weeks could very easily turn into six to eight weeks if the injury nags on longer than expected. Either way, the Yankees are going to be down one of their big league players for the next month and a half or so.
