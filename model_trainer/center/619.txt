However, a strong special teams play led to the Browns getting the ball back with favorable yardage. Sanders took the field again and threw an accurate pass to Kaden Davis for his first NFL touchdown. The Panthers would take the field again, but also stalled due to a strong Browns defensive stand. When Sanders took the field again, he delivered a huge pass to Luke Floreria.

James isn't the only person to react to Sanders having a good game, as his father Deion Sanders also took to X to voice his excitement for his son's play. Yes Lawd! Yes! @ShedeurSanders ‚Äî COACH PRIME (@DeionSanders) August 8, 2025 Sanders stated, "Yes Lawd! Yes! @ShedeurSanders." This was followed by several other posts on X praising his son. At the time of this writing, Shedeur has put together an impressive day that includes 11-for-18, 102 yards, and two touchdowns. He has also stacked on four carries for 19 yards. Shedeur is presumed to start the third quarter as well, getting even more chances to prove that he is worth being on the 53-man roster. The Browns currently have five quarterbacks, including Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel, Sanders, and Tyler Huntley. Pickett and Gabriel are dealing with hamstring injuries, which trust Sanders into the starting role. The Browns signed Huntley to back up Sanders through preseason. Flacco is the presumed starter, but he could be unseated if Sanders showcases more elite skills through the rest of his time starting. For more on the Browns and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.
