The Spanish Icon's History The Mosque‚ÄìCathedral of C√≥rdoba, officially called the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, was built as a mosque over 200 years starting 785 CE. The mosque opened in 988 CE, and remained a Muslim site for nearly 300 years before the Christian conquest of Cordoba in 1236 CE. The structure converted to a cathedral, undergoing additional modifications and building until one final, major addition in 1607 CE. Since then, the structure has stood as a sterling example of Moorish architecture and has even been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Mosque-Cathedral has had its share of small controversy starting in the early 2000s when Muslims requested to return and pray on the site. A group of Spanish Muslims in 2006 petitioned Pope Benedict XVI for permission to worship, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. A group of Muslim tourists tried to pray on the site in 2010, leading to a brief clash with security guards, leading to the arrest of two men after they injured two guards.
