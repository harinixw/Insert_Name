Inconsistencies may occur. ‚úñ The New York Yankees have struggled a lot since the All-Star break, and some of that blame can be placed on the team's closer, Devin Williams. Williams has made eight appearances since the All-Star break and recorded four saves in that time. But he's also blown two saves and received a loss in that same span. To make matters worse, the righty has allowed at least one run in six of the eight appearances. Lucas Babits-Feinerman of Yanks Go Yard recently suggested that Williams was playing his way out of the Bronx with his atrocious production this season.

Justin Casterline/Getty Images "For a pitcher as talented as Williams, with a sustained track record of success, I fully expect him to put together another dominant stretch before the end of the season," Babits-Feinerman wrote. "However, I would not trust him with the closer responsibilities, especially when three other guys in the bullpen can do the job (Weaver, David Bednar, Camilo Doval). "And if Williams does right the ship, I would extend the qualifying offer at the end of the season, expecting him to decline it and sign a long-term deal elsewhere. If he accepts and calls the bluff, then the Yankees have an expensive but potentially dominant setup man for 2026." It's hard to predict what the Yankees will do with Williams because they still seem to have a lot of confidence in him. Despite his 5.44 ERA, he's only blown three saves and been handed the loss four times. Of these four losses, one of them came in a tied game in extra innings when he surrendered the ghost runner (as an unearned run). His numbers aren't great, and he might not be ready for the bright lights in the Bronx, but there's still a chance the Yankees look to hold onto him. Manager Aaron Boone seems to like and trust him despite his inflated ERA.
