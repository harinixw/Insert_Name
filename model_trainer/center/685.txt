R.J. Anderson of CBS Sports believes that it's likely that the Marlins will pick up trade talks for Alcantara in the offseason. MIAMI, FLORIDA - AUGUST 4: Sandy Alcantara #22 of the Miami Marlins delivers a pitch in the game against the Houston Astros at loanDepot park on August 4, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

Alcantara has a 6.44 ERA entering Friday, which is nearly triple the number he posted in his Cy Young-winning 2022 season. Along with an inflated ERA, the Marlins righty has seen a staggering decline in his strikeout numbers. Despite the statistical decline, teams were interested in Alcantara at the deadline, as the right-hander is under contract next season and has a team option for 2027. Alcantara will turn 30 in September and has rebounded in his four second-half starts with a 3.60 ERA since the halfway point. The Marlins right-hander entered the season as the presumed headliner for starting pitching at the trade deadline, but his poor performance deterred teams that are looking to make a run. While he still garnered interest at the deadline, most teams likely thought the price was too high as the New York Yankees declined to send any of their top 5 prospects in a potential trade, according to Jon Heyman. With essentially two seasons of control with good performance, if suitors think that Alcantara has worked out the kinks and can return to top form next season, the Marlins would be wise to listen to offers over the winter.
