But after 22 months of war, that's exactly what Benjamin Netanyahu wants. What would long-term occupation mean for Gazans, Israel, the Middle East and the world? What would it be like for those living in Gaza? Will the Israeli hostages be returned? And is there any other option in Netanyahu's eyes? Niall Paterson is joined on the Sky News Daily by a Palestinian aid worker in Gaza and Professor Yossi Mekelberg, senior consulting fellow for the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House to answer those questions. To hear more on Gaza, Yalda Hakim speaks to author Anshel Pfeffer on the latest episode of The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim.
