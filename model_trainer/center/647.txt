She has been dealing with a groin injury that has kept her out for quite some time. Even more unfortunate for the Fever has been the lack of any kind of return timetable. No one knows when Clark will be able to get back on the court. As of right now, Indiana holds a 17-14 record. Following a clutch five-game winning streak, the Fever have lost their last two games. It's clear that they are missing Clark's scoring and playmaking ability in a big way.

"More so coaching the refs," she said. "I would make a good ref. I wouldn't miss a call." Clark has had her run-ins with WNBA referees throughout her first two seasons. She has also received more than her fair share of hard fouls and cheap shots. Throughout her second WNBA season, Clark has only been able to play in 13 out of the 31 games Indiana has played. When she has been on the court, Clark's production has taken a hit by dealing with the nagging injuries she has been forced to play through. In her 13 games played, Clark has averaged 16.5 points per game to go along with 8.8 assists, five rebounds, and 1.6 steals, while also shooting 36.7 percent from the floor and knocking down 27.9 percent from the three-point line.

With that date just a few days away and no positive updates being shared about her, that might not be realistic. Hopefully, some good news will come out about Clark in the near future. Until then, the Fever will have to simply tread water and try to stay within striking distance of the playoffs. During that time, Clark will continue being the team's biggest cheerleader from the sideline. Make sure to follow Newsweek Sports for all Indiana Fever and WNBA news and updates.
