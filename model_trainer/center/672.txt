After a very aggressive offseason, the roster is vastly improved from where it was at this time last year. Speaking of last season, the Bears were hoping to make this step in 2024. Unfortunately, they finished with a 5-12 record and in last place in the NFC North division. That disappointment led general manager Ryan Poles to make quite a few roster moves. He went out and traded for offensive linemen Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and then signed names like Drew Dalman, Dayo Odeyingbo, and Grady Jarrett.

However, putting a better product and winning on the field is a much more difficult thing to do than simply making roster moves.

Bleacher Report's Kristopher Knox recently put together a list of one player that each team in the NFL should look to trade. When it came to Chicago, he suggested that the team consider moving on from tight end Cole Kmet. "The Bears would be wise to see what they can get for Kmet now," Knox wrote. "Moving him should bring an enticing return while saving a cool $10 million in cap space." Kmet could be available for the right price. The Bears made the move to select former Michigan standout tight end Colston Loveland in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

Last season with the Bears, Kmet played in 17 games. He racked up 47 receptions for 474 yards and four touchdowns. Back in 2023, he caught 73 passes for 719 yards and six touchdowns. At just 26 years old, Kmet could be a nice long-term addition at tight end for any team around the league that could use the help. Should he be made available, it seems likely that they would be a fairly decent-sized market that opens up for him. For more on the Chicago Bears and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.
