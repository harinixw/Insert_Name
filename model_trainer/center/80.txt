'Leader' Lauder takes player-assistant coach role at City Image source, SNS Published 8 August 2025 Hayley Lauder says it "makes sense" to take on a player-assistant coach role at Glasgow City. The 35-year-old midfielder fills the position after former assistant Leanne Crichton joined Rangers as their new head coach. Lauder has made 252 appearances since joining City in December 2014 and has won seven SWPL titles, two Scottish Cups and one League Cup. "I'm very excited," Lauder said. "The stage that I'm at playing wise, it is a move that makes sense for me. "I can continue providing that support as a player to the team, but also as a member of staff to Leanne [Ross]. "We have always had a good relationship and one that is really honest. We can challenge each other, but always have that respect there. I'm looking forward to continuing that." City head coach Leanne Ross said Lauder's "knowledge of the game is exceptional" and added: "She's been a leader on the pitch for years - now she'll bring that same insight and passion to the coaching side."
