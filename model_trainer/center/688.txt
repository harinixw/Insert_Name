On Thursday, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen delivered one of the most heartwarming gestures of the NFL preseason by gifting not one but two Ryder Cup tickets to Nathan Forrestel, a Special Olympics athlete and golf influencer with cerebral palsy.

Forrestel, known to his 45,000 Instagram followers as @natethegolfguy, was standing near the sideline when Allen approached him with a question. "Hey, I've got a question for you. I've got two tickets to the Ryder Cup. They're yours if you want them. Are you up for that?" he asked the superfan. Forrestel's reaction was pure joy. He shouted "Yes! Yes! Yes!" before embracing Allen in a moment that quickly went viral across social media platforms. Josh Allen gifted this fan Nate, a golfer with cerebral palsy, two tickets to the upcoming Ryder Cup.

Tickets have been nearly impossible to come by, with the international showdown in less than 50 days now. But Allen, who had access through the Bills organization, saw an opportunity to share the experience with someone who truly loves the game. "I know the Bills have had them for a while; obviously, it's in New York this year," Allen told reporters after practice, as quoted by the Democrat and Chronicle. "Obviously it's in New York this year, so why not have the only New York (NFL) team send some of our Bills Mafia fans over there?" Forrestel, 25, was born with cerebral palsy and has used golf as a way to inspire others and bring humor to his life. His Instagram bio reads, "I'm Nate I am a golfer with cerebral palsy! I create golf and comedy content! I want to inspire people and make people laugh!!!" Allen had previously signed Forrestel's jersey earlier in camp, and the two shared a lighthearted exchange about their golf games. The pro has also swung clubs in tournaments like the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, gifted custom clubs to teammates, and even visited Augusta National. Though he won't attend the Ryder Cup himself due to the Bills' schedule, Forrestel will be there cheering on Team USA.
