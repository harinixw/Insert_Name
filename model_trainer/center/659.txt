Recently, Bleacher Report's Kristopher Knox suggested Parsons would be the Cowboys' best trade chip ahead of the regular season. "Dallas has a recent history of waiting until the last minute to reach contract agreements," Knox wrote. "This led to massive deals for wideout CeeDee Lamb and quarterback Dak Prescott‚Äîwho now makes $5 million more per year than any other player. Parsons is now set to top the $41 million annually that T.J. Watt will make on his new deal. "If Parsons is prepared to leave, the Cowboys should see what they can get in return. They're unlikely to be serious Super Bowl contenders within the next few seasons, and paying more than $130 million per year for three players would be hard to justify if they aren't. Trading Parsons would likely bring back a pair of first-round picks and more. The Cowboys owe it to themselves to see just how high his price tag might go."

ORCHARD PARK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 17: Micah Parsons #11 of the Dallas Cowboys walks on the field prior to the game against the Buffalo Bills at Highmark Stadium on December 17, 2023 in Orchard Park, New York. The Bills won 31-10. More Rich Barnes/Getty Images If Parsons is on the trade block, every team in football, including the Buffalo Bills, needs to check in on a trade. But does this idea even make sense for Buffalo? From a roster perspective, this move makes a lot of sense. The Bills need another star on the defensive side of the football, and every team in the league could benefit tremendously from adding Parsons. Buffalo also has the draft and player capital to get a deal done. But this trade doesn't make sense because the Bills have no money to spend. The entire issue with Parsons and the Cowboys is his contract, so if Dallas has to trade him, it'll be to a team that can sign him to a long-term deal worth a lot of money. The Bills can't afford to do that. As fun as this idea would be, the Bills would need to clear well over $40 million off their books per season to afford Parsons. It's possible, but it's impractical and very, very unlikely.
