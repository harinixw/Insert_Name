Why It Matters Henriette is the eighth named storm of the Pacific hurricane season. Its formation was shortly followed by Tropical Storm Ivo, which started to develop much closer to land southwest of Mexico's coast. Forecasts show Henriette passing by Hawaii beginning early Sunday, although the storm is not expected to make landfall. National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist Joseph Clark, who works at the Honolulu office, told Newsweek that Hawaii is not expecting impacts from the storm. A map from the National Hurricane Center shows Tropical Storm Henriette passing northeast of Hawaii this weekend. A map from the National Hurricane Center shows Tropical Storm Henriette passing northeast of Hawaii this weekend. National Hurricane Center What To Know As of the most recent update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Henriette's maximum sustained wind speeds were documented at 40 mph, with higher gusts. Animated weather footage from windy.com shows gusts measuring around 47 mph. The storm is moving westward around 17 mph and will likely turn west-northwest later on Friday and further northwest over the weekend, "keeping the center of Henriette well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands." The storm is expected to produce several inches of rainfall over the next three days, according to the windy.com maps, but the rain will remain offshore. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a below- normal hurricane season for the Eastern Pacific, with 12 to 18 named storms. Of those, five to 10 will likely become hurricanes, and two to five could develop into major ones. Matthew Rosencrans, lead for NOAA's seasonal hurricane outlook, told Newsweek that the agency will not issue a revised update for the Eastern Pacific season, as storms usually peak from July to September. Rosencrans added that the "early ramp-up" to the season was "a little surprising," but that the Eastern Pacific is performing below average in terms of total activity. Although there have been several storms, Rosencrans said most have been weak and short-lived. Aside from Henriette, south-facing Hawaii beaches are facing high surf advisories on Friday. Beachgoers were cautioned of the surf, which could reach up to 10 feet on Friday and 14 feet on Saturday. What People Are Saying NHC, in a forecast update for Henriette: "Henriette could degenerate to a remnant low later today. Restrengthening as a tropical storm is expected over the weekend, and Henriette could become a hurricane by Monday." What Happens Next As of the most recent forecast update, there are no hazards affecting land. The NHC will continue monitoring the storm. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
