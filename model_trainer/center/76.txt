The 33-year-old left Bristol City 10 years ago, having played 27 games and captained the side when it was known as Bristol Academy. Ingle won her 142nd international cap for Wales at Euro 2025 this summer after recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury last September that kept her out of the entire 2024-25 campaign. "After speaking to Charlotte [Healy, the City head coach] and everything that the club offers both on and off the pitch, it felt like a good fit. The club wants to get promoted and I love winning," Ingle said. "It is going to be tough in this league, but I want to get back playing to the best I can and offer as much as I can for this team." Ingle joined Liverpool in 2015 before signing for Chelsea, where she won 11 trophies, including five Women's Super League titles and an FA Cup during her seven seasons with the club. The deal with Bristol City includes the option of another year. "Sophie has an affinity to Bristol City and understands the history of this fantastic club," Healy said. "She is a world-class player whose talent, experience and leadership will help project this club to where we want to be."
