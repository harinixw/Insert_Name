Inconsistencies may occur. ‚úñ The New York Yankees were one of the best teams in baseball during the first half of the season, but they've seemed to fall off a cliff over the last few weeks. The spotlight has been firmly placed on manager Aaron Boone because of the team's struggles. Boone is almost always highlighted as the man to blame, especially when the Yankees lose a close game. Lucas Babits-Feinerman of Yanks Go Yard suggested the Yankees would move on from Boone following this season, considering how poorly they've played as of late. MIAMI, FLORIDA - AUGUST 02: New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone looks on during batting practice prior to a game against the Miami Marlins at loanDepot park on August 02, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

Rich Storry/Getty Images "The Yankees lost the World Series last year because they played a poor fundamental game, and this year it hasn't gotten any better," Babits-Feinerman wrote. "From base running mistakes to mental errors on defense, the problem is endemic within the organization. They are anti-clutch, and often it seems like Boone not only makes the wrong decision, but the worst possible decision for the situation. "The Yanks lead the AL in run differential (runs scored - runs allowed) but are on the verge of missing the playoffs. They are under .500 in one-run games and extra-inning games. The impact of a manager is hard to quantify, but I think they should bring the best out of their players when it matters most, and Boone's Yankees beat themselves far too often." Boone's job has been in question for years now, it seems, yet the veteran manager remains at the helm for the Yankees. However, if the Yankees miss the postseason, there's a chance he's finally fired. For a team like the Bronx Bombers with a payroll like they have, it's inexcusable to miss the postseason, especially when Aaron Judge is still producing at the rate that he is. If the Yankees hold onto a postseason spot, like it seems they will, Boone will almost certainly be back with the team next year. There aren't any better options on the market to replace him.
