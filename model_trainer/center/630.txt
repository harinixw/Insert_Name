BetMGM Bonus Code NW150 For MLB Friday, NFL Preseason BetMGM Bonus Code NW150 New User Offer Bet $10, Get $150 Bonus (MI, NJ, PA, WV Only) or $1,500 First-Bet Offer In-App Promos Parlay Boost Token, MLB Daily Swing, etc. Terms and Conditions 21+ and Present in Participating States Bonus Last Verified On Aug. 8, 2025 Information Confirmed By Newsweek Today's MLB slate features every team, providing new users with countless betting opportunities. Games like Astros-Yankees, Red Sox-Padres and Blue Jays-Dodger headline the day, although there are several other interesting matchups. The NFL Preseason continues with Lions-Falcons, Browns-Panthers and Commanders-Patriots. The Lions started their preseason with the Hall of Fame Game last week, but the other teams playing on Friday are all playing their first game. We will see several notable rookies, including Shedeur Sanders, who will start for the Browns. The WNBA delivers three games to bet on, too. Use the welcome offer you are eligible for to bet on any of these games. Most users will get the $1,500 first bet offer, so let's start there. You will have the opportunity to bet up to that amount and get a bonus refund if your bet settles as a loss. For example, maybe you want to bet $800 on the Browns and Sanders to get a win. If that does happen, you will get a large payout. If your bet loses, you will get an $800 bonus refund credited to your account. With the $150 bonus offer, you must win your initial $10 bet. So, make sure to look at a wide range of betting options before placing your first bet. Targeting something like a prop bet might bet a smart way to go, as opposed to a moneyline bet. Once you find a bet you are comfortable, place your wager and wait for it to settle to see if you win the bonus bets. Odds For Friday NFL Preseason Games As noted above, we likely will not see much of star players for the teams playing preseason games tonight. However, we will see draft picks take the field for the first time as professionals. Let's take a look at the odds from BetMGM Sportsbook: Lions: -3.5 (-110) / O32.5 (-110) / -190 Falcons: +3.5 (-110) / U32.5 (-110) / +155 Browns: +6.5 (-110) / O32.5 (-110) / +240 Panthers: -6.5 (-110) / U32.5 (-110) / -300 Commanders: +6.5 (-110) / O34.5 (-110) / +220 Patriots: -6.5 (-110) / U34.5 (-110) / -275 Read more NFL preseason betting odds, picks for August 8: CLE-CAR, DET-ATL, WAS-NE Secure BetMGM Bonus Code NW150 Offer Claiming this offer from BetMGM Sportsbook is simple.
