The 23-year-old was beaten 7-5 4-6 3-6 by her French opponent, who won the 2022 tournament. Garcia, the former world number four, will now face Karolina Muchova after the 31-year-old's first victory since 19 March, having announced in May, external she would retire later this year. Kartal's loss followed first-round exits for fellow Britons Katie Boulter and Jacob Fearnley. Boulter, 29, was beaten 6-0 7-5 by Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who will now face Emma Raducanu - who recently dethroned Boulter as British women's number one - in the second round. Elsewhere, five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams went down to world number 42 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. The 45-year-old American received a wild card entry to Cincinnati after reaching the second round of the Citi Open in Washington last month, but was beaten 6-4 6-4 by her Spanish opponent.
