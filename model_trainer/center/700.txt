Newsweek has emailed Nordstrom for comment. Why It Matters Jewelry recalls involving hazardous metals have previously led to regulatory action and significant public concern about the quality and safety of products sold in leading U.S. retail outlets. Cadmium is a naturally occurring heavy metal often used in jewelry manufacturing due to its low melting point, resistance to corrosion, and ability to enhance the appearance of gold-tone finishes. However, its inclusion in consumer products has raised significant health concerns. When jewelry containing cadmium is worn regularly or mouthed‚Äîespecially by children‚Äîit can leach into the skin or be ingested. Cadmium exposure can cause long-term health effects, including kidney, bone, and reproductive harm.

L-R: Monica Vinader 14k Yellow Gold Mini Heart Chain Bracelet, 14k Yellow Gold Mini Heart Stud Earrings, 14k Yellow Gold Mini Heart Chain Necklace. Monica Vinader What To Know On August 7, Monica Vinader recalled about 300 units of its 14k Yellow Gold Mini Heart Chain Bracelets, Necklaces, and Stud Earrings, admitting the items may contain more than 100ppm of cadmium levels. In the United States, cadmium in children's jewelry is policed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Since a wave of recalls in 2010, the agency has relied on case-by-case enforcement. There is still no federal numeric limit for cadmium in adult jewelry, so several states have stepped in. The Monica Vinader bracelet measures about 15.3-19 cm, the necklace about 41-46 cm and the earrings each measure about .35 cm x 0.4 cm x 0.1 mm, according to the CPSC. The items were manufactured in Thailand between October and November 2024 and sold by Monica Vinader and Nordstrom‚Äîboth online and in physical stores‚Äîbetween November 2024 and May 2025, the U.K.-based jewelry maker said, at prices ranging from $250 to $350. No injuries or incidents have been reported, the CPSC said. What People Are Saying In a statement on its website Monica Vinader said: "Our commitment to exceptional quality and safety is at the core of everything we do. Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily initiating a recall of certain products." What Happens Next Consumers are urged to immediately stop wearing the jewelry, keep it out of children's reach, and contact Monica Vinader for a prepaid return, which includes a choice of replacement jewelry or a refund. Nordstrom customers can also return the products directly to the retailer. Details on the recall and instructions are available on the Monica Vinader recall website. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
