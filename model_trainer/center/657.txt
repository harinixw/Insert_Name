Kayla Kleine told Storyful that a bear regularly visits the family's yard in Vancouver. This time, however, the furry trespasser saw the door left open and seized his opportunity. He entered the home on Monday and began eating her 3-year-old Pomeranian's breakfast. Protective of not only the house but also his food, Scout decided to defend his rights, setting aside any potential fears and seemingly forgetting the size difference. The 5-pound dog came sprinting from another room, chasing the bear straight out of the house and incessantly barking. Kleine shared the footage on her TikTok account @kaylakleine, which reached 4.5 million views and 737,300 likes within three days of posting. Scout didn't stop once the bear ran off. He followed the bear outside, leaping off the deck with determination, making sure the bear wouldn't come back. Meanwhile, Kleine sprinted behind, grabbing bear spray, terrified it would end differently. But the feisty Scout didn't care. He chased the bear to the fence and continued to bark, warning him to stay away. Kleine told Newsweek that once she saw the bear over the fence and Scout proudly barking, she laughed, relieved he was safe. Kleine said she was getting ready in the other room with music playing, which is why she never heard the bear inside. She then heard Scout's food bowl moving against the floor. This concerned her as her husband was away on a work trip and Scout was sitting on the bed. She suspects the bear was inside for about four minutes before Scout went after him. A follow-up video shows Scout proudly standing in the backyard, keeping watch on the perimeter. The text on the clip reads: "He's been like this ever since he defeated the bear."

But once they discovered the dog was a Pomeranian, they hilariously thought it checked out. Small dogs tend to act big and tough. One user wrote: "He jumped all the steps. Was on a mission." Another jokingly asked: "Do either one of them know what type of animal they are?" And a third commented: "They deserve all the treats!! Protecting their family."
