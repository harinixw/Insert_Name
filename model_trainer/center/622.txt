Darcy Miller, known on TikTok as @darcycass, received an urgent call shortly after selling her couch on Facebook Marketplace from the buyer. The buyer discovered a cat inside the couch. As it turns out, Miller's cat managed to sneak her way into the couch through a tear underneath. She became a stowaway, riding her way to the buyer's home silently and without anyone realizing. Miller rushed to the buyer's home as soon as she heard the news. Her July 28 Instagram video shows her attempting to lure her cat out of the couch, asking why she would do that. And because of the unfamiliar location, her feline hesitated. Newsweek reached out to @darcycass via Instagram for additional information and comment. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Darcy Miller (@darcycass) Miller calmly and carefully talked to her cat, reassuring her that there was nothing to fear. She brought along kitty treats, hoping they would do the trick. The cat's eyes peeked out from under the couch. She looked at the strange room and retreated to her hiding space. But when she heard the crinkle of the treat bag, she took a leap of faith and came out. Miller praised her for being a "brave girl" when she finally stepped all the way out from her hiding spot. Viewer Reactions The Instagram video reached over 292,000 views as of Friday, leaving viewers cracking up over the unfortunate situation, and after knowing Miller successfully got her cat back. "Did you tell them the sofa looks great and she was just the quality control making sure it got there safe?" joked one viewer. Another added: "Sofa on Marketplace: $50. Sofa w/a bonus cat inside: Priceless." A third person said: "Poor baby went for a nap, woke up in a whole new world." What viewers find even crazier is that this wasn't the first video they saw involving couches sold on Facebook Marketplace and cats. Newsweek previously reported on the other incident, when a buyer found a cat crawling out of the couch at 3 a.m. This time, the buyer kept the cat, as the seller said she did not belong to them.
