Both fighters successfully made weight at 170.6 pounds and are set to compete for a chance to advance in the tournament in the Welterweight category. Esperança, known for his explosive fighting style and strong pride in representing Angola, spoke with Forbes.com and other select media at Media Day about his journey, mindset, and the significance of fighting on a platform like PFL Africa. For him, this bout is more than just a fight; it's an opportunity to showcase his skills on the growing African MMA stage. When Esperança steps into the cage, he will not only be fighting for victory but also carrying the hopes of his nation. "For me, I’m proud to represent my country," he stated at the PFL Africa Media Day. "I think Angola needs winners right now. I’m a winner. I have the mentality of a winner." That winning mindset was evident in his explosive PFL debut nearly a year ago, a performance that not only introduced him to a new audience but also reaffirmed his reputation. "Explosive is a good word to describe my style," he said with a grin. "Some people call me 'the machine' because I’m an energetic guy. I love to enter my fight dancing. Win or lose, I’ll dance anyway because I give you all my energy. This Saturday will be a party for sure." First MMA Bout in Johannesburg Shido Boris "The Machine" Esperança at the PFL Africa Media Day In Johannesburg, South Africa Supplied/PFL Africa MORE FOR YOU While Esperança has faced a variety of opponents across multiple promotions worldwide, Saturday marks a milestone — his first MMA fight in Johannesburg. “I’ve fought in South Africa before, in Cape Town, but that was Jiu-Jitsu,” he explained. “This is my first MMA fight here. I’m very excited and very happy.” Now 30 years old and balancing his fighting career with fatherhood, Esperança says his experience has brought him calm and maturity. “Before, I was a kid. Now, I’m a grown man. I’m more mature than before, and now I’m a father to a daughter.” When asked how his background shapes his mindset under the bright lights, he was clear: “Now I’m very calm.” For him, Saturday is “just one more day, one more day to show my skills.” As PFL Africa launches its first season, Esperança’s blend of youth, experience, and maturity positions him as a fighter ready to make a lasting impact on the continent’s growing MMA scene.

It is a deeply personal endeavour that has provided him with an outlet for the discomfort, prejudice, and hostility he encountered growing up as a minority in Spain. He has transformed those experiences into something constructive. “Believe it or not, I used to walk in the street and people used to spit at me, to hate me for no reason. I didn’t know why,” he said, recalling moments that shaped his resilience. “I didn’t know why they hated me.” As a young man, those experiences could have hardened him. Instead, he chose to channel them into something that could inspire others and not further inflict pain on others. “For all these people who grow up with hate, with anger, you can transform that into something productive,” he said. For him, the fight arena became a proving ground, not just to test his skills but to demonstrate that negativity can be reshaped into discipline, ambition, and purpose. “It’s my inspiration to do something good for the world. To inspire people who live or who grow up in anger, in hate, in difficult environments,” he explained. “That is not forever. Your life can change if you think in another way, if you believe you can do something big.” In Esperança’s eyes, success isn’t defined by championship belts alone. It’s about showing others that their circumstances don’t limit their potential. “You can be a good sportsman or a good professional in your work, that’s my goal. My first goal is to do something to inspire people,” he said.

We have the genetics, we have everything to be the biggest stars in the world because we are natural fighters. This is a big gate PFL is opening for us, and it’s just the beginning of something big.” For aspiring fighters in Angola, Esperança’s journey offers proof that the dream is attainable. His rise has been built on resilience, dedication, and a belief in turning personal challenges into fuel for growth. A Champion for Women in Combat Sports That message of opportunity extends beyond gender. Asked during Women’s Month in South Africa what advice he would give to aspiring female fighters, Esperança was clear: “I love to see women fighting because they show that it’s possible. It doesn’t matter if you’re a man or a woman, you can make your dream come true. I am a big supporter of women’s fighting.” Angolan Roots and a Continental Vision While his career has taken him far from home, Esperança’s fighting spirit remains tied to Angola’s growing sports culture. Competitive MMA is still developing in the country, but he believes it’s only a matter of time before Angolan fighters make a global mark. “There’s a lot of talent and a lot of kids who want to push themselves to reach something big,” he said. “MMA and other sports in Angola are growing; in the future, you will see that for sure.” That belief, in himself, his country, and his continent, fuels the fighter known for mixing intensity with celebration. Whether it’s his dancing walkouts or his ability to connect with fans through raw authenticity, Esperança brings more than just technique to the cage. He brings personality, pride, and purpose.

However, instead of feeling pressure, he sees it as another opportunity to put on a show. “All fights for me are exciting,” he said. “This is just one more chance to do what I love, to give you all my energy, and to represent Angola the best way I can.” For Esperança, tonight’s bout isn’t just about his record. It’s about building a legacy, one that opens doors for African fighters and inspires people from all walks of life to turn adversity into achievement. “When I win or when I lose, I will dance anyway,” he said. “Because I’m giving you everything I have. And I’m proud to do it for Angola.” Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER... FORBES’ FEATURED Video
