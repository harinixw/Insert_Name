Cleveland Browns vs Carolina Panthers - NFL Preseason Week 1 Cleveland Browns vs Carolina Panthers - NFL Preseason Week 1 Coley Cleary How to Watch Browns vs Panthers Date: Friday, August 8, 2025 Time: 7:00 PM ET Channel: NFL Network (National Broadcast), WEWS-ABC (Cleveland), FOX - WJZY (Charlotte) Stream: Fubo (TRY FOR FREE) The wait is finally over as the NFL preseason is officially here, and these two squads continue their preparation for their opening games of the regular season during this matchup. We likely will not see many of the stars in action, as Joe Flacco and Bryce Young will almost certainly get the night off. However, there are still plenty of storylines to follow. The biggest thing to watch for in this game will be the Browns' quarterback competition. Shedeur Sanders is slated to get the start for Cleveland, and much has been made of the rookie signal-caller since he fell in the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders is at his best when the lights are bright, so expect him to try and prove the doubters wrong in this one as he looks to at least secure the backup job. This is a great NFL matchup that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action.
