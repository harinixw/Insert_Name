After trailing 10-7 at halftime, the Lions stormed back to take a 17-10 lead after a Jake Bates 57-yard field goal and Kyle Allen touchdown pass in the third quarter to set up what could have been an intriguing fourth quarter. But on the Falcons' final drive of the game, Lions cornerback Morice Norris went down with a scary injury that led to him leaving the stadium in an ambulance. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport later confirmed Norris had suffered head and neck injury.

"We have not seen any movement out of Morice Norris and our cameras really couldn't get much of a view as they had so many personnel around him trying to take the best care possible. "But there was kind of a chilling moment ‚Äì it gave you goosebumps ‚Äì where as they got Morice Norris up (on the backboard), his entire team began to run out onto the field and make like a semi-circle. ... Because all these guys want is to see something from their teammate to know he's OK."

"It was tough to watch, it was tough for the other team to see, getting a teammate hurt that way," Morris said, via On3. "It was the right thing to do for (lions head coach) Dan (Campbell) and his team, and everything they had going on. I thought it was the right thing (to do)... It was just common ground, common courtesy. Just didn't like the look of it." Hours after the game ended, Bleacher Report's James Palmer gave an update on Norris' condition. "UPDATED STATEMENT FROM THE DETROIT LIONS: Morice Norris is in stable condition and has feeling and movement in all his extremities," Palmer posted on X. "He will remain at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta overnight for observation."
