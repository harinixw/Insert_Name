In the AL, Yankees star Aaron Judge was shorter than -500 across the board, while Shohei Ohtani was even further ahead of the pack in the NL, at -1600. Though 60-plus games remained in the regular season at that point, Ohtani appeared well on his way to winning the award yet again after capturing it in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Judge's recent injury has opened the door to current MLB home run leader Cal Raleigh, who hit his league-best 42nd home run of the year on July 31. In fact, Raleigh's odds are now as short as +220 (as of August 8), as we'll detail below.

DK FD BetMGM Shohei Ohtani -1400 -1500 -1000 Kyle Schwarber +750 +900 +550 Unfortunately, as you can see above, the short answer right now is, "not exactly." Schwarber, it is worth noting, was available at as short as +500 at some sportsbooks earlier this week. But unfortunately for anyone hoping to see Schwarber stay on Ohtani's heels down the stretch this year, the Dodgers star racked up four total hits -- including a double and a home run -- in his team's last three games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The promising news for Schwarber is that three of the Phillies' next four series are against playoff contenders in the Rangers (Aug. 8-10), Reds (Aug. 11-13) and Mariners (Aug. 18-20). With some fireworks in those high-profile series, Schwarber could stay within arm's reach of Ohtani as the schedule inches toward the final month of the regular season. Schwarber, who has hit 10 homers in 18 games since the break, is on pace to finish the season with 57 dingers, but at this point, it seems like he would need to get to 60 -- and top Raleigh -- to steal a significant number of votes from Ohtani. One last note on Schwarber before we turn our attention to the AL race: his 10 homers in 18 games since the break is well ahead of both Raleigh (4) and Ohtani (7). American League MVP Betting Odds DK FD BetMGM Aaron Judge -400 -410 -325 Cal Raleigh +265 +270 +220 Despite hitting just four home runs in his last 18 games since the All Star break, Raleigh's MVP campaign is getting stronger thanks to an injury that favorite Aaron Judge just returned from on August 5. In his first two games back from a right elbow flexor strain he suffered in late July, Judge filled the Yankees' DH spot and went a combined 1-for-6, with a walk and three strikeouts. As long as Raleigh keeps getting on base -- he has 15 hits since the break, including a nine-game streak with a hit from July 20-29 that included multiple 2-hit games -- the AL MVP race could get even more competitive as we get closer to September. And obviously, if Raleigh gets the long ball going again after going yard just once in his last nine games, he could absolutely beat out Judge for this award, so stay tuned to the Mariners breakout star. At the moment, it feels too soon to recommend a bet on Raleigh, but if Judge continues to show the effects of his elbow issue at the plate, a play on Raleigh could be justified sometime within the next week.
