Now, it’s got a limited edition Satin White look to match. The new variant brings a fresh finish to the flagship 8K camera with subtle glitter accents, vibrant orange details, and matching accessories. And to prove that style doesn’t come at the cost of ruggedness, Insta360 launched it 23.6 miles into the stratosphere. It was made possible by Sent Into Space. Insta360 says its new X5 captured “stunning footage, proving its mettle in the harshest environment imaginable.” Along the way, it’s claimed to have faced temperatures as low as -68°F and exposure to sunlight 30% stronger than Earth-level conditions. The Satin White Insta360 X5 Limited Edition is more than just a color refresh. The white body features subtle glitter, striking orange accents, and an aesthetic that extends to the bundled accessories: a matching lens cap, protective pouch, and even the 114cm Invisible Selfie Stick. Internally, the latest X5 remains unchanged. So, you get dual 1/1.28-inch sensors, 8K 30fps video, PureVideo AI noise reduction for low-light conditions, and AdaptiveTone for dynamic exposure and color control. It’s designed for cinematic-grade results, whether you're filming a city skyline at night or a sun-drenched summit. MORE FOR YOU Insta360 X5 Satin White Limited Edition Insta360 Insta360 has also introduced optional ND filters for the X5, available in ND16, ND32, and ND64 strengths. These are tailored for handling extreme brightness, enhancing motion blur, and delivering more color-accurate footage. The camera auto-detects each ND filter to optimize settings for varying lighting conditions. The Satin White edition is just as rugged as its original sibling. That means you get IP68-rated dust and water resistance. Plus, it is waterproof up to 49ft (and up to 197ft with the Dive Case), and scratch-resistant, replaceable lenses. It features the same Wind Guard as the regular X5 to ensure clear audio even in tough environments. Insta360 claims up to 208 minutes of continuous 5.7K shooting with fast charging to 80% in just 20 minutes. The Insta360 X5 Satin White Limited Edition also includes a free 1TB cloud storage subscription (worth $107.90) for auto-backups, cloud editing, and one-click sharing. Insta360 X5 Satin White Limited Edition: Price and Availability The new Insta360 X5 Satin White Limited Edition is now available globally. It went on sale earlier this week on August 5 for $549.99. Once purchased, you can claim a free 1-year Insta360+ subscription with 1TB of cloud storage, valued at $107.90. Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...
