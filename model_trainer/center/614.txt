Now it's about surrounding him with the best group of wide receivers heading into the season. First-year head coach Aaron Glenn will have some tough decisions to make, but one of the easier ones should be moving on from wide receiver Malachi Corley.

EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY - DECEMBER 01: Malachi Corley #14 of the New York Jets leaps as he is tackled by Devon Witherspoon #21 of the Seattle Seahawks in the first quarter of a game at MetLife Stadium on December 01, 2024 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. More Luke Hales/Getty Images Corley struggled last season as a rookie with now-Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. He appeared in just nine games for the Jets last season and recorded three catches for just 16 yards with no touchdowns. Yes, you read that correctly: three catches all season. The average receiver is pulling in three to four passes per game. While he only had six targets, it's still an awful season. New York filled its wide receiver room with veterans such as Josh Reynolds, Tyler Johnson and Xavier Gipson to be depth behind Garrett Wilson and Allen Lazard. Corley is going to really have to step it up in the preseason if he wants to make the roster. All three of the depth names above have multiple years of experience in the NFL with Reynolds going into his ninth year in the league. Glenn being a first-year head coach gives Corley some benefit of the doubt in that he has a clean slate. However, the more experienced veterans are going to get the inside track to make the team. It's going to take a lot for Corley to make the team. His best bet may be to hope the Jets decide to keep six receivers on the 53-man roster. He'll get his first chance to make an impression Saturday night against Green Bay.
