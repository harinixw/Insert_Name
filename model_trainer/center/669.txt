Harry How/Getty Images Wood debuted with the Braves in 2013. As a rookie he made 31 appearances (11 starts) just one year after he was drafted out of the University of Georgia. With a funky left-handed delivery, he proved adept at both starting and relieving ‚Äî a role he maintained after a July 2015 trade sent him to Los Angeles. Wood posted the best season of his career in 2017, going 16‚Äì3 and posting a sparkling 2.72 ERA for the Dodgers. His start in Game 4 of the World Series was particularly dominant: a 7.2-inning, one-run masterclass in befuddling an opponent that was illegally stealing opposing catchers' signs. The Houston Astros defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game series; their sign-stealing operation only came to light years later.

He returned to the Dodgers as a free agent in January 2020 ‚Äî just in time to help them secure a World Series ring. He allowed only one run in 6.2 postseason innings, giving Los Angeles its first championship since 1988. Wood revived his form with the Giants in 2021, turning in a strong 10-4 mark with a 3.83 ERA and 152 strikeouts.

In his final season with Oakland in 2024, Wood made only nine starts before he suffered a season-ending rotator cuff injury in May. "To all my teammates, coaches, and staff ‚Äî it was an honor to chase the dream with you for so long," Wood wrote on Instagram. "Your daily dedication and sacrifice were incredibly inspiring. I always aimed to be the best teammate I could be and to build up those around me. If my teammates remember one thing about me, I hope it's that." For more MLB news, visit Newsweek Sports.
