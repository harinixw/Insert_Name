On a memorable walk with bestselling author Kelly Corrigan, she told me how she's become a master of getting unstuck: She's found that simple, physical breaks — like walking, dancing, or just moving around — can reset her mood and focus. So I wanted to share a few of her tricks, especially for anyone who writes, thinks or stares at a screen for a living (hi, me too)! Sponsor Message Feeling stuck? Hit play and dance it out Kelly's favorite fix for writer's block: a three-minute dance break. "I love music so much," she told me. "It's the cheapest way to change your mood." Forget toxic productivity. When the vibe turns sour, don't power through — shake it off. Literally. Grab your phone, play a song you love, and move. You might be one verse away from your next great idea. Get up while you're catching up Writing can feel like a sedentary sport, but Kelly tries to get upright whenever she can, especially during phone calls or research listening sessions. Not every task allows for it, but many do. Scheduling a dentist appointment? Returning a call? Try doing it on foot. Kelly Corrigan and Manoush Zomorodi enjoying a windy walk.

It's not about perfection. It's about caring for the environment where her ideas take shape. Work with your body — not against it The biggest insight? Stop trying to be productive all day long. Kelly doesn't schedule much for early afternoons — she knows that's her low-energy time. "I don't fight with myself anymore about how I work and what my periods of rest look like," she said. Sponsor Message Most of us don't have a writer's flexibility, but we can get curious about our own rhythms and make micro-adjustments. Think of these breaks as just part of the creative process.
