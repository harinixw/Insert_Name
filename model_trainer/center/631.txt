New York is on a two-game winning streak, which includes a previous victory over the Wings, an 85-76 win in New York. The Liberty put forth a balanced effort, overcoming an uncharacteristically quiet night from star Sabrina Ionescu (2-for-9, 9 points). Five different players scored in double figures, led by Jonquel Jones (15) and Leonie Fiebich (14), with Stephanie Talbot scoring 13 off the bench in the win. Dallas continues to search for continuity, as they've dealt with injury issues for much of the season, but they do have a healthy Paige Bueckers leading the way. In the 85-76 loss to the Liberty, Bueckers scored 21 points, grabbed eight rebounds, and dished out four assists. Maddy Siegrist added 13 points off the bench for the Wings, who trailed by just two at halftime. This will be the third and final matchup between the teams this season, after splitting their first two matchups. Live stream New York Liberty vs Dallas Wings on Fubo: Watch the event now!
