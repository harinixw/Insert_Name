This canine gets the best of both worlds‚Äîenjoys the perks of socialization and playtime at doggy day care without ever leaving her owner, who is known on Reddit as u/Fit_Wasabi_139. This is because the owner works at the day care. However, being in the same facility and not the same room wasn't enough for her dog, Gracie Mae. On the subreddit channel r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog on Monday, she shared security camera footage of her dog trying everything in her power to be reunited. The owner was working in the office, with a window overlooking the outdoor area where the canines played. One wall separating them was one wall too many for Gracie Mae. Her dog used her front paws to grab onto the windowsill, trying to pull herself up and through the window, back into the comfort of her owner's presence. Gracie Mae's hind legs scratched at the wall in a desperate attempt to give her more leverage. Screenshots from an August 4 Reddit post of a pooch attempting to climb through the window at doggy day care to get to his owner in the office.

Fit_Wasabi_139/Reddit A few dogs huddled around, curious about her plan. One appeared to be on lookout, making sure no one caught her, while the other supervised. But after a few seconds, she threw in the towel. The owner shared in the Reddit post that no one needed to worry; her dog is safe and sound. And with no injuries to report from this unsuccessful attempt, the owner now laughs at the footage the security camera captured. Gracie Mae's plan to be with her owner came as a bit of a surprise, as this isn't the first time she brought her to work. The owner shared in another Reddit post that she adopted Gracie Mae a few months ago, after living in an animal shelter for about six months. The 5-year-old dog is the "sweetest" and "plays so well" at day care whenever she brings her. Newsweek reached out to Fit_Wasabi_139 via Reddit messenger for additional information and comment. The Reddit post reached 215 upvotes as of Friday, with viewers jokingly writing what was going through Grace Mae's mind: "Let me in! LET ME INNNN!" Another added: "Let me in! There's too many dogs out here." Someone pointed out: "Husky was no help at all lol GIVE HIM A BOOST!" Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?
