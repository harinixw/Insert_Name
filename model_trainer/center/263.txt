Courtesy of Kroma Wellness In the ever-evolving world of wellness, it seems like new trends and buzzy bio-hacks emerge almost daily—but few have captured attention, and controversy, quite like colostrum. Touted for its immune-boosting and gut-healing benefits, the once-niche ingredient has exploded across social media and supplement aisles alike, with brands marketing bovine-derived powders and capsules as the next health and longevity essential. But while its benefits are well-documented, the $1.7 billion global colostrum market has remained oddly stagnant on one major front: nearly every product relies on the same base of bovine colostrum, sourced from mother cows in the first few days after birth. Not only does that raise ethical red flags for a large swath of consumers, but it also leaves out the 65% of the population who are lactose-intolerant and the growing number of people seeking dairy-free or plant-based alternatives. Lisa Odenweller saw this disconnect, and within it, an opportunity. As founder and CEO of Kroma Wellness, Odenweller has built her brand on premium, clean, science-backed nutrition. Now, she’s launching Super Core, the world’s first dairy-free, human-optimized colostrum supplement. “The idea stemmed from a deep belief that we could do better—both for the body and for the planet,” she says. “We saw a clear opportunity to innovate, creating a formula that offers the powerful benefits of colostrum, but designed for humans, free of dairy, and aligned with modern values.” With Super Core, Odenweller and her team have created a new category entirely, offering the benefits of colostrum without the cow. Powered by Effera™, a proprietary, human-identical form of lactoferrin made through precision fermentation, the supplement is designed to be more compatible with the human body, more effective, and more ethically aligned. And in an increasingly crowded and commoditized wellness space, it’s a bold attempt to not just ride the wave but to reshape it entirely. Super Core is powered by Effera™—a proprietary, human-identical form of lactoferrin made through precision fermentation—that's designed to be more compatible with the human body, more effective, and more ethically aligned. Courtesy of Kroma Wellness “Effera mirrors the colostrum that’s naturally found in human breast milk,” Odenweller explains. “It’s non-allergenic, non-immunogenic, and designed to work seamlessly with human biology. We can only absorb up to 70% of bovine lactoferrin; whereas we can absorb 100% of Effera.” That distinction matters. Lactoferrin plays a key role in iron regulation, microbiome health, gut lining repair, and immune defense, but many consumers who’ve tried cow-derived versions experience bloating, inflammation, or hormonal issues. With Super Core, Kroma is aiming to deliver the same clinically backed benefits, minus the dairy and discomfort. MORE FOR YOU While the science is compelling, the positioning is also strategic. “We’re reaching two key groups,” Odenweller says. “People already using colostrum who are looking for something more effective and ethically aligned and people who’ve avoided colostrum entirely because of dairy, digestive issues, or sourcing concerns.” There’s a business case for both. With more consumers prioritizing ethical formulations, transparency, and gut health, Super Core is poised to capture, and expand, the existing market. And it’s not just a lateral product swap; Kroma claims Super Core is 15 times more potent than traditional cow colostrum products, requiring only one scoop per serving compared to three or four with other brands. That potency, coupled with Effera’s patented technology, explains the $120 price tag, a significant premium in a category long dominated by $40 jars of powdered cow colostrum. “Transparency and education are key,” Odenweller says. “Effera is not a commodity ingredient—it’s the result of cutting-edge biotechnology and years of R&D. When you combine scientific rigor, ethical formulation, and superior efficacy, the price reflects that investment.” For Odenweller, who previously founded lifestyle wellness brand Beaming and scaled it to 10 locations across Southern California, Super Core represents more than just a product launch. It’s the opening move in what she sees as a new frontier in wellness: human-identical nutrition. From human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) to growth factor analogs, she believes the future lies in supplements that mimic and work with our biology, not against it. “Human-identical bioactives are the future of targeted nutrition,” she says. “We’re just at the beginning of this movement.” That movement also reflects Kroma’s broader approach to wellness. Since launching with its cult-favorite 5-Day Reset, the brand has expanded to nearly 20 instant, functional nutrition products designed to support everything from immunity and hydration to stress and sleep. Each product is clean, shelf-stable, beautifully packaged, and designed to be as easy to use as “just add water.” Odenweller sees Super Core as the beginning of a new frontier in wellness that focuses on human-identical nutrition.

It means prioritizing efficacy and ethics over mass appeal. And it means holding fast to a brand identity that centers quality, without compromise. “Every product must serve a clear, functional purpose,” she explains. “If it doesn’t meet our standards for efficacy, taste, and clean formulation, it doesn’t launch.” Of course, building a premium wellness brand in an increasingly crowded, price-sensitive space comes with its own set of challenges. But Kroma isn’t trying to be the cheapest option—it’s aiming to be the best. “We know wellness needs to be more accessible—and we’re working toward that,” Odenweller says. “At the same time, we’re deeply committed to using the highest quality ingredients we can find: organic superfoods, adaptogens, organic ceremonial-grade matcha, grass-fed collagen and bone broth made in Australia through a proprietary process. Using ingredients like this cost a lot more, but we are not willing to compromise—and we know our customers can feel and taste the difference.” For Kroma, accessibility doesn’t mean lowering quality—it means expanding how people can try the brand, whether through new formats, bundles, or flexible pricing tiers. The brand’s customer base continues to grow through word-of-mouth and a highly engaged community that includes celebrities, influencers, and everyday users alike. “Our ambassadors and customers alike share one thing in common: they’ve experienced real transformation,” Odenweller says. “Our strategy is simple: amplify real stories, grounded in real results. That’s what drives long-term loyalty.” With Super Core, Kroma isn’t just launching another supplement—it’s starting a conversation. One about how ingredients are sourced, who they’re made for, and what it really means to support the body at a foundational level. And for Odenweller, that conversation is long overdue. “In an industry full of noise, real disruption is about quiet, confident innovation that actually works and changes people’s lives,” she says. And if Super Core is any indication, that’s exactly what Kroma is setting out to do. Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER... FORBES’ FEATURED Video
