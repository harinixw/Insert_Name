Inconsistencies may occur. ‚úñ The New England Patriots wide receiver room continues to expand with talent and bodies, which will lead to some tough decisions in the next few weeks. One of those tough decisions could come in the form of second-year wide receiver Ja'Lynn Polk who didn't see much action last season. The 23-year-old receiver was taken 37th overall in last year's draft, but he hardly produced as a rookie for New England. He caught just 12 passes (on 33 targets) for 87 yards and two touchdowns.

More Megan Briggs/Getty Images Not every rookie receiver will come in and light it up like Ladd McConkey did for the Los Angeles Chargers, but Polk's rookie stats were abysmal to say the least. Even after Drake Maye took over as the starter, Polk still did not get much of an opportunity and wasted lots of chances he did receive. Factor in the addition of Mack Hollins to the receiver room, and there's a real chance Polk could be out of a job. In the first unofficial depth chart, the Patriots listed Polk among the top six wide receivers. With most teams rostering no more than six receivers, he's barely making the cut. However, unofficial depth charts as very unreliable. The team could prefer Hollins to him and just want to showcase they're giving Polk a chance. Polk is one of many players who will need to have a strong preseason to prove to Mike Vrabel and the coaching staff that he deserves to stay. Vrabel has reportedly stated everyone has a clean slate, but Polk's roster spot is far from secured.
