Why It Matters Members of the Trump administration and some of his supporters have referred to him as "peacemaker-in-chief," often citing his foreign policy efforts and recent nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House has claimed that Trump has personally intervened in negotiations between countries in conflict, helping broker ceasefires or peace agreements, although some foreign leaders dispute the extent of his involvement.

More AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta What To Know Some of Trump's efforts are more fragile and temporary than others. He pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine war on his first day back in office. The Israel-Hamas conflict also continues without resolution, with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepening significantly. Late in July, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a ceasefire following several days of deadly border clashes that killed three dozen and displaced more than 260,000 people, according to the Associated Press. Trump posted on his social media during the conflict that he had spoken with both leaders and pushed them for a ceasefire. Malaysia helped mediate the truce. Despite the agreement, both sides have accused each other of violations. In June, leaders from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a U.S.-brokered peace agreement to end their decades-long deadly conflict. It called for joint security coordination, "respect of borders" and "refrain from any acts of aggression." In mid-June, Israel launched surprise attacks on Iran. The Islamic Republic retaliated, although not with the same scale of destruction that Israel continued to strike with. Days later, the U.S. militarily got involved by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites, Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz, in the largest B-2 operation in U.S. history. Shortly after, a fragile ceasefire was agreed to. India and Pakistan had a major clash over Kashmir this year, and Trump in May announced on Truth Social a ceasefire between the two countries. Trump said the talks were mediated by the U.S., a claim that Indian leaders have disputed. Many critics have said that several of the ceasefires and peace agreements Trump has championed have proved fragile, with some breaking down or facing violations within weeks of being announced. Other critics have questioned how much involvement the president and administration had in the negotiations. Supporters, however, believe he should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The president has been formally nominated by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Negotiations or Deals Trump Administration Has Worked On Armenia and Azerbaijan (August) Thailand and Cambodia (July) Israel and Iran (June) Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo (June) India and Pakistan (May) What People Are Saying Kaja Kallas, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in a Friday statement: "Today's agreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan by Prime Minister Pashinyan and President Aliyev, in the presence of President Trump in the White House, mark a significant breakthrough to end decades of conflict. We strongly commend both sides and the US Administration for using the momentum and making progress possible. It will now be important to ensure the timely implementation of the agreed steps, notably the signing and ratification of the peace treaty." President Donald Trump, on July 28: "I've stopped six wars‚ÄîI'm averaging about a war a month." White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a July 31 statement: "The president has now ended conflicts between Thailand and Cambodia, Israel and Iran, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia. This means President Trump has brokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office." Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet: "This is but one example of President Trump's exceptional achievements in de-escalating tensions in some of the world's most volatile regions. His consistent pursuit of peace through diplomacy aligns perfectly with Alfred Nobel's vision-honoring those who have made outstanding contributions to international fraternity and the advancement of peace." What Happens Next Leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday signed an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict. The agreement pledges to create a major transit corridor in the region that will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, according to the Associated Press. Nobel Prizes are set to be announced in October. Update 8/8/25, 5:40 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information. Is This Article Trustworthy? Is This Article Trustworthy?
