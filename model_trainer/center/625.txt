With his first shot at doing so, the young passer secured his first passing touchdown after the Browns secured a red zone situation from a muffed punt by the Panthers.

It wasn't until the waning minutes of the first quarter that the Browns pounced on a muffed punt, setting the team up on the 20-yard line.

The pass was on point, as Sanders took his time to line things up. It was a bit scary to see Sanders throw the ball into traffic, but Davis wrapped it up to give the quarterback his first professional touchdown.

Joe Flacco is the presumed starter and is not set to suit up during the first preseason matchup against the Carolina Panthers. The Browns also added some insurance in the form of Pro Bowl quarterback Tyler Huntley. Sanders is expected to take most of the starting duties, with Huntley presumably coming in around the third or fourth quarter. Sanders, the Browns' offense was struggling to get things going in the first quarter, despite some solid throws by the young signal caller. He also showcased some great thinking when he rifled off a rush following the Panthers rushing five against him. At the time of this writing, Sanders is 6-for-11, 40 yards, one touchdown, and one rush for 10 yards. Before the preseason showdown began, it was revealed that Sanders would likely get around 50 plays in his debut, but should he throws another touchdown before the second half, he may be pulled. This is just speculation, but the head coach, Kevin Stefanski, could send Tyler Huntley out a little early.
