If you’re familiar with terms that are often brought up during this stage, it can help you know what to look for. You’ll also be better prepared to protect your investment and negotiate the best terms for the property. 1. Title The title is the legal right to own and use a property. During closing, you’ll review a title report to confirm there are no liens, boundary issues, or ownership disputes. You’ll also purchase title insurance as a safeguard. 2. Escrow Escrow is a neutral third party—often a title company or attorney—that holds funds and documents until all closing conditions are met. Think of them as the referee that ensures money only changes hands when everything checks out. 3. Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) This is your initial deposit (often 5–10%) that goes into escrow when you sign the PSA. It shows you’re serious. If you default on the deal, the seller may keep this money. 4. Time of the Essence This contract clause refers to deadlines for a transaction. If you miss a critical date (like closing), the seller may cancel the deal or keep your deposit. You’ll want to pay attention to these clauses and make plans to stay on track. MORE FOR YOU 5. Lease Estoppel If you're buying a leased property, this is a document signed by tenants confirming lease terms, rent amounts, and that the landlord hasn’t breached the agreement. It protects you from surprises post-close. 6. Pro Rata Adjustments These are financial adjustments made based on who owns the property when. If closing happens mid-year, you might reimburse the seller for prepaid taxes or collect your share of rents. 7. As-Is, Where-Is This phrase means you're buying the property in its current condition, faults and all. Commercial real estate is a “buyer beware” market, so your due diligence is critical. 8. Contingency Period A window of time (often 30–60 days) when you can walk away from the deal without penalty if certain conditions aren’t met—like financing approval or clean inspections. 9. Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) The PSA is your formal contract to buy the property. It outlines price, closing date, contingencies, financing, and legal protections. Get a good attorney to help draft or review it. 10. Closing Statement This is the final ledger of the deal. It lists every dollar moving in or out—purchase price, closing costs, prorations, and loan disbursements. Review it line by line before wiring your funds. The Power of Knowing the Terms Understanding this vocabulary will help you increase your overall knowledge of real estate investing. It will also enable you to make better decisions, ask smarter questions, and avoid costly mistakes. The closing itself is more than a formality. It marks the point where your vision becomes a reality. Once you know these terms, you’ll be ready to move through the steps, close the deal, and start generating returns on your investment.
