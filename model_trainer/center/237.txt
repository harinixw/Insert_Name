A visitor compares the weight of Samsung's new ultra-slim smartphone, the Galaxy S25 Edge (Photo by Chris Jung/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images Galaxy S26’s Exynos Tweak the external question from Smsung’s community around the Gaalxy S handsets always inclues “Qualcomm or Exynos?” The community generally looks for the slightly more powerful Qualcomm, but with a new approach to cooling, will the Exynos match the Qualcomm option in time for the Galaxy S26? "Samsung is expected to power some or all of its Galaxy S26 series phones with the Exynos 2600 SoC. The Exynos chips have proven to be more difficult to cool but it looks like the company has come up with a solution and it comes in the form of a ‘heat pass block’ (HPB). If it does result in a cooler SoC, Samsung would be more willing to fit all of its future flagship phones with its in-house processor." (NotebookCheck). MORE FOR YOU Latest Look At Pixel 10 Pro Design Ahead of the launch on August 20th, official renders of the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro have leaked. These not only show off the now recognisable design of the Pixel 10 family, but the colors of the handset and the silvered ‘edge rails’ along the long edges of the smartphone. And it’snot going to be to everyone's liking: "Unfortunately, this does show that the sides of the Pixel 10 Pro will indeed be glossy again this year. Google believes that glossy side rails make the Pixel 10 Pro look and feel more “premium,” even though most people dislike this design move." (Android Headlines). Final Pixel 9 And Pixel 9 Pro Special Offers Ahead of the Pixel 10 family’s arrival, Google has slashed the prices of various Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 prices in the Google Store, with discounts between £250 and £350 here in the UK (the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is also discounted, but to a lesser extent). This could be it for official pricing: "There will almost certainly be more after the Pixel 10 officially launches this month, but I don’t see Google dropping the price by much more until next year. With that said, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw more aggressive trade-in deals, like June’s promotion that paid out hundreds of dollars for years-old phones." (Forbes). OnePlus Gears Up For New Look Will onePlus shake up its design language for the upcoming OnePlus 15? That’s the intriguing prospect leaked this week, with the camera island one of the key changes under discussion: "The tipster claims that the engineering prototype of the OnePlus 15 has a new rear camera design. The circular rear camera housing has been a consistent design choice for OnePlus flagships since the OnePlus 11. However, the OnePlus 15 may adopt a compact square camera module design. The new camera module may reflect OnePlus’s previously announced plan to revamp the design language of its future smartphones." (DCS via NotebookCheck). What Shall We Name This Dish? The traditional naming of a new Android version with a confectionery theme is set to continue with Android 17. Which sweet are we hoping to see? Aamir Siddiqui has the results of a recent survey on the community choice: "We received about 1900 votes on our survey, and Cheesecake emerged as the top choice for Android 17’s dessert codename, getting more than 530 votes for a 28% share. Churro is the runner up, with almost 15% votes, following which we have Crème Brûlée at almost 13%, ." (Android Authority). And Finally... Popular open-source media streaming app NextPipe (which includes options for YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, and more) has released a new version, which includes support for Android Auto: "More specifically, the car integration allows you to access and play streams from your history and from your local and remote bookmarked playlists, search YouTube or any other service you have currently selected in NewPipe, and control the player including the playing queue. Make sure to only use those features when it’s safe, to avoid getting distracted." (NewPipe blog). Android Circuit rounds up the news from the Android world every weekend here on Forbes.
