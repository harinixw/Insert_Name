Washington Commanders vs New England Patriots - NFL Preseason Week 1 Washington Commanders vs New England Patriots - NFL Preseason Week 1 Coley Cleary How to Watch Commanders vs Patriots Date: Friday, August 8, 2025 Time: 7:30 PM ET Channel: WUSA-CBS (Washington, DC), Patriots Preseason Network (New England), MyNetworkTV (WCTX ‚Äì Hartford- New Haven, CT) Stream: Fubo (TRY FOR FREE) The wait is finally over as the NFL preseason is officially here, and these two squads continue their preparation for their opening games of the regular season during this matchup. We likely will not see many of the stars in action, as all of Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, and Stefon Diggs will almost certainly get the night off. However, there are still plenty of storylines to follow. TreVeyon Henderson will be the player to keep a close eye on in this matchup if he gets some playing time, especially if you are a fantasy football player looking for a sleeper. Henderson was an explosive runner at Ohio State, and the Patriots' second-round pick should immediately step into the pass-down role in the offense. Look for him to show off his big-play ability in this one. This is a great NFL matchup that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action. This is not a nationally broadcast game, but it can still be live-streamed locally with Fubo on WUSA-CBS (Washington, DC), Patriots Preseason Network (New England), and MyNetworkTV (WCTX ‚Äì Hartford- New Haven, CT). It will be aired via tape delay later on NFL Network. Live stream Commanders vs Patriots for free with Fubo: Start your subscription now! Regional restrictions may apply.
