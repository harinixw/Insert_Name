On his podcast, "The Deadman" bestowed this incredible honor upon the former World Heavyweight Champion, GUNTHER. The WWE Hall of Famer has been officially retired from in-ring competition since 2020. He made it clear that while he is staying retired, a match with "The Ring General" would have been a special attraction. The Undertaker's Ultimate Endorsement While speaking with GUNTHER on the latest episode of his Six Feet Under podcast, The Undertaker was effusive in his praise. He said that GUNTHER's style and presence are what would have drawn him back for one more match. "If I had anything left in the tank, you're the one guy that I would consider coming out of retirement to work with," Undertaker said. "From the moment that I saw you at Clash at the Castle, I was like, dang, I would have loved to have worked with you." He then joked with the Austrian star, "I wish you would have got your s*** together a little sooner and got here quicker... But it would have been really good. I might have put you over. We'll never know now, but the match itself would have been awesome."

WWE/Getty Images More news: WWE Superstar Announces Retirement Match The Undertaker is arguably the most respected superstar in WWE history. For 30 years, his "Deadman" persona, his legendary undefeated WrestleMania streak, and his role as the locker room leader made him an icon. His praise is considered the highest possible honor a current superstar can receive. Like The Undertaker, GUNTHER has established himself as a dominant and feared champion. His record-breaking 666-day reign as Intercontinental Champion was universally acclaimed, and his subsequent run as World Heavyweight Champion was equally dominant until he was defeated by CM Punk at SummerSlam last weekend. A dream match between The Undertaker and GUNTHER is a compelling "what if" because of their similar, old-school wrestling philosophies. Both men are known for their brutally physical, realistic, and story-driven in-ring styles. The Undertaker specifically mentioned GUNTHER's classic, hard-hitting match against Sheamus at Clash at the Castle in 2022 as the moment that first caught his eye. An endorsement from a legend like The Undertaker is a massive vote of confidence in GUNTHER, especially coming just days after he lost his world title. While the match will only ever exist in fantasy, "The Deadman's" comments have solidified GUNTHER's status as one of the most respected competitors in the industry.
