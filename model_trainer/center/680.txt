One of the bigger additions to the team was Shane Bieber, formerly of the Cleveland Guardians. Bieber hasn't made a big league appearance this year as he recovers from Tommy John surgery. The righty is slowly approaching his 2025 debut in Toronto. Edward Eng of Jays Journal recently predicted the Blue Jays would cut ties with veteran starting pitcher Chris Bassitt following the addition of Bieber at the trade deadline.

TORONTO, ON - AUGUST 1: Shane Bieber #57 of the Toronto Blue Jays looks on from the dugout ahead of play against the Kansas City Royals in their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on August 1, 2025 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. More Mark Blinch/Getty Images "As a pending free agent at the end of the 2025 season, Bassitt has been reliable and productive during his three years with the organization. The veteran right-hander has posted three straight seasons with double digits in wins, including leading the American League with 16 in 2023," Eng wrote. "This year, Bassitt has gone 11-5 with a 4.12 ERA, 1.31 WHIP, along with 126 strikeouts in 129 innings pitched over 24 games played. "At 36 years old, Bassitt will likely be looking for one final multi-year contract to lead up to his potential retirement. With Bieber now representing the Jays' most ideal replacement option for Bassitt in the rotation, and players like Trey Yesavage closing in on their big league debuts, this will likely become Bassitt's last season with Toronto as a result." Bassitt sits on an expiring contract and didn't seem to be returning to Toronto before the Bieber addition. Adding Bieber is seemingly the nail in Bassitt's coffin with the Blue Jays. The Blue Jays have a few talented pitchers surging up the minor leagues. Bassitt is likely going to take a one or two-year deal with whichever team is willing to give him the most money. Either way, whether it's the Blue Jays' choice or Bassitt's, the righty is likely done in Toronto following this season.
