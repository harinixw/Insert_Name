The world No. 2 and reigning Masters champion opted out of the FedEx St. Jude Championship in Memphis, citing rest and schedule management. But in doing so, McIlroy may have exposed a loophole in the PGA Tour's playoff format, one that officials are now scrambling to address.

(Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images) More The Grand Slam winner's absence was not unexpected. He had hinted as early as last November that he would likely skip Memphis, noting his poor finish there last year and minimal impact on his playoff standing. "I finished basically dead last there this year (2024) and only moved down one spot," McIlroy told The Telegraph last year. With currently 3,444 FedEx Cup points, he's virtually guaranteed a spot in the Tour Championship at East Lake -- even if he also skipped the BMW Championship next week. Yet McIlroy's decision has left many concerned PGA Tour Policy Board player director Peter Malnati told Golfweek he was "very concerned" and hinted at possible future measures to prevent top players from skipping playoff events. "I think there is stuff in the works, and I'll leave it at that," Malnati added. Social media was quick to dub any potential rule change the "Rory Rule." The timing couldn't be riper. With major season getting over, August is dull, and McIlroy's absence has become a lightning rod for debates about player responsibility and the Tour's authority. McIlroy is the only player among the top 70 to skip Memphis. His decision reflects a calculated move to preserve energy for a grueling end-of-year stretch that includes the BMW Championship, the Tour Championship, the Ryder Cup and international events in India and Australia.
