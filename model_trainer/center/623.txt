What a dot ‚Äî E.L. Chandler (@ELChandler5) August 8, 2025 START HIM. ‚Äî Ghost Aeolus (@Aeolus) August 8, 2025 There are few who are voting against Sanders, as he has already become one of the most popular players in the NFL. Even more interesting is that he emerged as the fourth-string quarterback before injuries thrust him into starting the first preseason game. Kenny Pickett and rookie Dillon Gabriel are No. 2 and 3 on the depth chart, respectively, but both are dealing with hamstring injuries. With both out, the Browns chose to bring in Tyler Huntley to act as the backup to Sanders.

The usual case for starting quarterbacks is not to play until the final preseason showdown. Sanders was given a huge chance to start, and he is taking advantage of that in a big way. At the time of this writing, he is currently 8-for-15, 63 yards, one touchdown, three carries for 20 yards. It is clear that the Browns fanbase is backing Sanders, as the telecast has showcased many fans in the stands wearing his jersey. Also, the internet is chock-full of responses from Browns and NFL fans gushing over the touchdown pass. To Sanders' credit, his first NFL touchdown was a beauty. He lobbed it into tight coverage and was still able to showcase his accuracy, which led to the big catch from Davis. Sanders will presumably play well into the third quarter, giving him plenty of time to showcase more of his pro-ready skills. Should he continue to impress in preseason action, he could jump his way into the backup role. Sanders moving up the depth chart is not a guarantee, but he will have more chances to keep playing some good football. For more on the Browns and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.
