The 29-year-old joins for an undisclosed fee. He has previously played for Leyton Orient and made over 100 appearances for Blackpool between 2020 and 2024, before his move to the Scottish Premiership. "I've played higher, I've played lower, and I know what it takes to push on and up, to get us out of this league," Ekpiteta told the MK Dons website. "I feel like I bring a lot of experience and some good qualities to the team." Manager Paul Warne added: "He's a big centre-half with pace, he's aggressive in both boxes, and I just think he's something the squad needs. "I tried to sign him before when he was at Leyton Orient, but he went to Blackpool, and I've tracked him ever since." MK Dons travel to Barrow on Saturday, having drawn their season opener 0-0 against Oldham.
