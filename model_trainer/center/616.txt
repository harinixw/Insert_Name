The Patriots 2025 second-round draft pick did the honors, as the Patriots hosted the Washington Commanders at Gillette Stadium. Under new head coach Mike Vrabel, the Patriots used the pick in somewhat surprising fashion, taking a running back with the 38th overall selection.

Winslow Townson/Getty Images TreVeyon Henderson out of national champion Ohio State ‚Äî last year's Big Ten leader in yards per carry with 7.1 ‚Äî became the highest pick of a running back by the Patriots since former coach and general manager Bill Belichick took Georgia's Sony Michel in 2018 with the 31st pick. Henderson quickly announced his presence, and the anticipated resurgence of the six-time Super Bowl-winning Patriots franchise, on the opening kickoff from the Commanders' Matt Gay. Henderson received the kick on the Patriots' goal line ‚Äî and instantly broke off a 100-yard return for a touchdown, the first time he touched the football in an NFL game, though admittedly a preseason one.

But on first down the next time the Patriots got the ball, Maye pitched out to Henderson who swung around the left side to run for an 18-yard gain.

Lopez (@LosTalksPats) August 8, 2025 "The Patriots haven't had a true elite running back since Corey Dillon was in New England in 2004. Still, during the team's 20-year run of success, they were blessed with multitudes of versatile backs who routinely gave defensive coordinators headaches," wrote Ryan McLaughlin of the Fansided Patriots site Musket Fire on Friday. "Enter TreVeyon Henderson, who fits that mold perfectly," McLaughlin continued. "The team is optimistic he can be a better version of James White and Kevin Faulk, who are arguably the best pass-catching running backs in Patriots' history." The preseason game against the Commanders appeared to also announce Vrabel's intention to put increased emphasis on the running game in the Patriots' offense this season. The 18-yard gain was Henderson's only carry of the first quarter, but fifth-year veteran Rhamondre Stevenson ran seven times for 36 yards, and Washington's 2020 third-round draft pick Antonio Gibson, now in his second year with New England, carried three times for 16 yards to open the game. Maye himself ran the ball twice for 16 yards and a touchdown before being removed in favor of backup QB Josh Dobbs.
