Drake Maye showed a lot of promise last year, which is exciting enough, but the Patriots built up the offense around him a lot better heading into the season. The offensive line is better, and the weapons around Maye are a lot better this season than last as well. FanSided's Rucker Haringey recently made the bold prediction that Patriots rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson would rush for 1,000 yards this year. FOXBOROUGH, MA - JULY 28: TreVeyon Henderson #32 of the New England Patriots heads to the field during training camp at Gillette Stadium on July 28, 2025 in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

Winslow Townson/Getty Images "The Patriots' ground game was shockingly inefficient last year. Rhamondre Stevenson led the team with 207 carries on the year, but averaged less than four yards per rush," Haringey wrote. "Stevenson is still on the roster, but it's telling that New England spent a second-round pick on Treyveon Henderson. He is not the sort of battering ram that Vrabel has utilized in previous seasons, but he has a rare ability to turn ordinary carries into explosive gains. "New England needs to do whatever they can to stop Maye from feeling like he needs to produce all the big plays. That's why Henderson is going to get a lot of work ahead of Stevenson as the season rolls along. He may start slow, but he'll finish strong and top the 1,000-yard mark as a rookie." Rushing for 1,000 yards in a season is quite a steep ask of the rookie running back, especially considering the Patriots' top rusher last season ran for 800 yards on over 200 carries. But the offensive line is better than last season, and Henderson is a better back than Stevenson and Antonio Gibson. If the Patriots are able to move the ball well and give the rookie over 200 carries, there's a chance he eclipses the 1,000 rushing yard mark en route to some consideration for Offensive Rookie of the Year.
