The Washington Post via Getty Images Timeline Aug. 8-14 net approval rating: The president’s net approval rating increased 0.4 points from last week, with 41% approving and 55% disapproving in an Economist/YouGov survey of 1,702 U.S. adults conducted Aug. 1-4 (margin of error 3) that shows the public continues to have a negative perception of the controversy surrounding the federal government’s handling of its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The Economist/YouGov survey found 68% of respondents said they believe the government is covering up evidence it has about Epstein, while 60% disapprove of the Trump administration’s handling of the controversy—which stems from the Justice Department’s decision announced last month that it would not release additional details of its probe into Epstein. Aug. 4-20: Trump’s approval rating declined to 38% and his disapproval rating increased to 58% in a UMass poll of 1,000 respondents released July 25-30 (margin of error 3.5), compared to 44%/51% in the group’s April poll. Trump’s approval rating on all four issues both the April and July UMass polls asked about—inflation, immigration, jobs and civil rights—declined, with immigration dropping the most points (nine). Aug. 4-3: Trump’s approval rating dipped two points, to 45%, in Morning Consult’s weekly poll of 2,201 registered U.S. voters conducted Aug. 1-3 (margin of error 2), while 42% disapproved. Monday’s rating is significantly better than Trump’s -15 net approval rating Morning Consult found at this point in his first term, when 40% of voters approved and 55% disapproved of his job performance. July 29-15: Trump’s rating remained mostly unchanged in The Economist/YouGov’s weekly survey out Tuesday compared to last week’s poll, with 40% approving of his job performance and 55% disapproving, according to the poll of 1,577 U.S. adults conducted July 25-28 (margin of error 3)—a one-point decline in his approval rating from last week, though his disapproval rating remained stagnant. July 28-3: The president’s approval rating increased two points, to 47%, and his disapproval rating declined two points, to 50% in Morning Consult’s weekly survey of 2,202 registered U.S. voters conducted July 25-27 (margin of error 2) compared to last week’s poll. The last time Trump had a net positive approval rating in Morning Consult’s poll was in March. July 24-21: Trump’s 37% approval rating is down from 47% in January, while 58% disapprove of his job performance, compared to 48% in January, according to a July 7-21 Gallup poll of 1,002 adults (margin of error 4). Trump’s average approval rating for the second quarter of his second term, April 20-July 19, is 40% in Gallup polling, compared to a 39% average in the second quarter of his first term but below second-term averages for every post-World War II president. July 22-14: Trump’s approval rating is unchanged from last week in the latest Economist/YouGov survey of 1,729 U.S. adults taken July 18-21 (margin of error 3.4), with 41% approving of his job performance and 55% disapproving, compared to a 49% approval rating and 43% disapproval rating at the start of his term, according to Economist/YouGov polling. An overwhelming majority, 81% of respondents, said the government should release all documents related to its probe into Jeffrey Epstein, while 69% said they believe the government is covering up evidence about Epstein, and 56% disapprove of Trump’s handling of the Epstein investigation. July 16-16: A total of 42% approve of Trump’s job performance, while 58% disapprove in a new CNN/SSRS poll of 1,057 respondents conducted July 10-13 (margin of error 3.5), representing a one-point improvement in Trump’s approval rating since April and a one-point drop in his disapproval rating. The majority, 61%, of Americans said they oppose Trump’s signature policy bill that would pay for tax breaks and additional border security, among other measures, in part, by cutting Medicaid, while 39% said they approve of the so-called megabill. July 15-14: Trump’s net approval rating dipped to its lowest point of his second term in Economist/YouGov polling, with 41% approving and 55% disapproving, according to the survey of 1,506 registered voters (margin of error 3.1)—consistent with his lowest approval rating of his first term, according to Economist/YouGov polling. July 14-3: Trump’s approval rating improved two points, to 47%, while his disapproval rating also improved two points, to 50%, in Morning Consult’s weekly survey of 2,201 registered voters with a two-point margin of error. July 2-16: Trump’s approval rating stands at 40% in a Yahoo/YouGov poll of 1,597 U.S. adults conducted June 26-30 (margin of error 3.2), a four-point decrease from the groups’ March poll, while 56% disapprove. Trump’s -16 net approval rating is three points worse than it was at this point during his first term, according to YouGov data, while former President Barack Obama had a +14 net approval rating and former President Joe Biden had a +7 approval rating halfway through their first years in office. June 30-3: Trump’s disapproval rating improved from 53% to 50% in Morning Consult’s weekly poll compared to its survey last week, while his approval rating increased from 45% to 47% (the survey of 2,202 registered voters was conducted June 27-29 and has a two-point margin of error). The rating was Trump’s best since May and coincides with an uptick in respondents’ approval of his handling of national security issues since last week, following a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. June 23-16: Trump’s approval rating dipped one point, to 41%, in a Reuters/Ipsos survey of 1,139 U.S. adults taken June 21-23 from its June 11-16 survey, with 57% disapproving (the latest poll has a 3-point margin of error). The poll also found a plurality, 45%, of U.S. adults surveyed do not support the airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, while 36% support them and 19% said they were unsure. June 17-13: An Economist/YouGov poll found 54% of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance, while 41% approve (the survey of 1,512 U.S. adults was conducted June 13-16 and has a 3.3-point margin of error). The survey also found Trump’s approval rating is underwater when it comes to his handling of Iran, with 37% approving and 41% disapproving, while 60% of respondents, including 53% of 2024 Trump voters, say the U.S. should not get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran, as Trump has repeatedly threatened U.S. military intervention. June 17-17: Trump’s net approval rating improved two points in the latest Pew Research survey taken June 2-8, compared to the group’s last poll in April, with the latest survey showing 41% approve and 58% disapprove (the survey of 5,044 U.S. adults has a 1.6-point margin of error). June 16-6: Trump’s net approval rating dipped two points in Morning Consult’s latest weekly survey of 2,207 registered U.S. voters (margin of error 2), with 46% approving and 52% disapproving of his job performance, numbers the pollster notes are on par with his ratings in April and early May, during a downward spiral that coincided with his shock tariffs. June 16-12: Trump’s approval rating remained stagnant at 42% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken June 11-16, compared to the groups’ May poll, but his disapproval rating increased two points, to 54%, in the latest survey of 4,258 U.S. adults (margin of error 2). June 16-4: Trump’s approval rating declined one point, from 47% to 46%, in the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris survey, compared to the groups’ poll taken last month, while 50% of respondents said they disapprove of his job performance (the online survey of 2,097 registered voters was conducted June 11-12 and has a 2.2-point margin of error). Trump’s approval rating in the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll has dropped every month since February, when he had a 52% approval rating. Trump’s approval rating for nine separate issues also declined from May to June, with less than half of voters saying they approve of each of them, with tariffs and trade policy receiving the lowest marks (41%) and immigration receiving the highest (49%). June 15-10 net approval rating: More than half, 55%, of voters said they disapprove of Trump’s job performance and 45% said they approve in an NBC survey of 19,410 U.S. adults conducted May 30-June 10 (margin of error 2.1). June 11-16: Trump’s approval rating dipped three points, to 38%, in Quinnipiac University’s latest poll conducted June 5-9 among 1,265 registered voters (margin of error 2.8), compared to its previous poll in April, when he had a 41% approval rating, while his disapproval rating dropped one point, to 54%. The survey also found more voters, 57%, have an unfavorable opinion of Elon Musk, while 53% have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, though more than half, 53%, oppose Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that was the source of Musk’s rant against Trump last week. June 9-10: A CBS/YouGov poll conducted June 4-6 found 45% approve of Trump’s job performance, while 55% disapprove (the poll of 2,428 U.S. adults has a, 2.4-point margin of error). In a separate, one-day YouGov survey conducted June 5, amid Trump’s feud with Musk, the majority of 3,812 U.S. adults (52%) said they side with neither Musk nor Trump, while 28% said they side with Trump, 8% said they side with Musk and 11% said they aren’t sure. June 9-4 net approval rating: Trump’s approval rating improved one point, to 47%, in Morning Consult’s weekly poll, while 51% disapprove of his job performance for the third week in a row (the survey of 1,867 registered U.S. voters has a 2-point margin of error). Trump’s feud with Musk doesn’t appear to have dented his approval ratings in the first two polls that overlapped with their public spat—though it’s unclear how Americans perceive his response to protests in Los Angeles over his aggressive deportation push, as no reliable polling has been released since the protests began over the weekend. June 4-4: For the first time in two months, less than half (49%) of U.S. adults surveyed by the Economist/YouGov disapprove of Trump’s job performance, compared to 45% who strongly or somewhat approve, representing a significant improvement from the groups’ April 19-22 poll, when Trump had a net -13 approval rating (the latest poll of 1,610 U.S. adults conducted May 30-June 2 has a 3-point margin of error). June 2-5: Trump’s approval rating dropped from 48% to 46% in this week’s Morning Consult poll compared to its previous survey, while his disapproval rating was stagnant at 51% (the May 30-June 2 poll of 2,205 registered voters has a 2-point margin of error). Surprising Fact The share of registered voters who say they identify with Trump’s Make America Great Again movement has increased sharply during Trump’s second term, according to NBC polling. A total of 36% of 1,000 registered voters polled March 7-11 said they consider themselves part of the MAGA coalition, compared to a 23% average in NBC’s March polling and 27% in the network’s 2024 polls (the most recent poll has a 3.1-point margin of error). Big Number 42%. That’s Trump’s average approval rating so far during his second term, higher than his 41% average approval rating throughout the duration of his first term, according to Gallup. What Was Biden’s Approval Rating At This Point In His Term? 49%, according to Gallup’s Aug. 2-17, 2021 average. Key Background Just after marking his sixth month in office, Trump is facing arguably the biggest public relations crisis of his second term as his base has broken with him over the Justice Department’s refusal to release documents detailing its investigation into Epstein. Among other major moments of his second term: Trump launched a military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities, leading to a cease-fire agreement during Iran and Israel. Congress also approved his signature policy legislation that will enact some of his most significant campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts and tighter border control. Trump’s approval rating has declined since the start of his term, with a notable plunge coinciding with his wide-ranging “Liberation Day” tariffs he announced on April 2 against nearly all U.S. trading partners, though he has largely backed off most of the levies. Prior to the Epstein controversy, the leak of U.S. military attack plans to Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was widely considered the first big crisis of Trump’s second term. His efforts to slash the federal workforce with the help of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and his mass deportation push are two other controversial hallmarks of his second term that have prompted numerous legal actions.
