However, the Englishman is taking things in stride, no doubt a result of having experienced this moment so many times. "Maybe this weekend is the weekend and we'll see," he told reporters after his second-round performance.

Andy Lyons/Getty Images Fleetwood didn't shy away from the elephant in the room -- that he remains winless on the American-based circuit -- but instead gave his perspective on the matter. He also mentioned how he plans to manage his emotions over the weekend. "We'll see," he said. "Happy to put myself in with a chance over the weekend. I think that's exactly where you want to be and keep testing yourself. Yeah, it hasn't happened for me yet out on the PGA Tour but I would much rather be up there and not quite get it done, than not there at all, and who knows ... But look forward to tomorrow first." The eight-time DP World Tour winner and current world No. 15 is arguably the best player among those who have never won on the PGA Tour. He's come close many times; Fleetwood has finished second six times and third five times in 161 tournaments played on the American circuit. The most recent occasion when a victory slipped through his fingers is still fresh in everyone's memory. It happened six weeks ago at the Travelers Championship, when he led by one stroke on the 18th hole, but bogeyed the hole after missing a 6-foot par putt, while Keegan Bradley responded with a birdie to win the event. Tommy Fleetwood shoots opening rounds of 63 and 64 to take the lead at the FedEx St Jude. He said after his round: "Happy to put myself in with a chance over the weekend... who knows, maybe this weekend is the weekend." Is it finally the week? pic.twitter.com/tHlyZ1FlmB ‚Äî Flushing It (@flushingitgolf) August 8, 2025 The truth is, Fleetwood has displayed high-level golf during the first two rounds of the FedEx St. Jude Championship. At TPC Southwind in Memphis, Tennessee, the Englishman carded eight birdies and a bogey on Thursday, and seven birdies and a bogey on Friday, for a 36-hole score of 13-under. Still, he is by no means resting on his laurels. "Of course, when you shoot two good scores, it's easy to say everything has been going well ..." he told the reporters. "Whatever score I am through two rounds, you're going to have done everything well, but I think still you've got to focus on the good stuff and try and keep that going." The FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first tournament of the PGA Tour playoffs, includes the top 70 players of the season in its field, 69 of whom are competing in Memphis. Only Rory McIlroy missed the event.
