This week's race features two major driver changes. Stewart Friesen suffered a major injury while racing in another series and is out of the No. 52 truck, with Cup Series driver Christopher Bell set to take the truck over this weekend. But Bell won't be in that truck long, as Kaden Honeycutt is set to take it over following this weekend. Honeycutt had been racing for Niece Motorsports and sits sixth in points, but he was released after informing the team he had signed with a different team and manufacturer for next season. He is in the Young's Motorsports No. 02 this weekend, while Connor Zilisch will race his old No. 45 truck. This is the second road-course race of the season for the Truck Series. Back in June, Heim dominated at Lime Rock, leading 99 of the 100 laps. Ty Majeski, Giovanni Ruggiero, Ben Rhodes, and Cam Waters rounded out the top five. This is a crowded field. In addition to Zilisch and Bell, full-time Cup Series or Xfinity Series drivers in the field include William Sawalich, Kyle Busch, Sammy Smith, Ross Chastain, and Chris Buescher.
