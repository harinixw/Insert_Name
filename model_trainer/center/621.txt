The rookie fifth-round pick got the start with Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, and Dillon Gabriel all out of the lineup, leaving Sanders and Tyler Huntley as the only two available QBs. Through the first two weeks of training camp, Sanders has mostly practiced with Cleveland's second- and third-team units as he sits fourth on the depth chart with his work cut out for him. Head coach Kevin Stefanski said before the game he expected Sanders to get roughly 50 snaps, meaning he's likely to play at least the first half and possibly into the third quarter.

The lyrics to the song state: "If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done" in a seeming show of confidence heading into what could be the most-watched preseason game in quite some time. Sanders' first few drives on Friday were nothing to write home about. A three-and-out followed by back-to-back punts left some fans questioning whether they should be concerned about the Colorado alum, who was struggling to move the chains.
