Inconsistencies may occur. ‚úñ Bed Bath & Beyond, the iconic American retail chain which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and shuttered all of its stores, is preparing to mount a comeback. Once a household-name company, Bed Bath & Beyond operated over 1,000 stores at its peak, and has now returned under the name Bed Bath & Beyond Home. The first of its new locations will open on Friday in Nashville, Tennessee. Why It Matters Bed Bath & Beyond's return to the physical stage‚Äîafter years of exclusively online operations‚Äîrepresents a rare resurrection in an increasingly challenging American retail environment. This year has been marked largely by consolidations, closures and layoffs in the sector. As well as the longer-term decline of the high street, prompted by a shift to e-commerce and declines in foot traffic, retailers are this year facing the prospect of tariffs impacting their bottom lines. What To Know Bed Bath & Beyond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023 after years of financial struggles. In the filing, the company reported $5.2 billion in debt as well as $4.4 billion worth of assets. Bed Bath & Beyond secured $240 million in financing shortly after, enough to fund its operations through the Chapter 11 process, but soon began liquidating its remaining stores. In June 2023, its brand name and digital assets were purchased for $21.5 million, and the company was transitioned into an online-only retailer. Its downfall was cited by MAGA Republicans as an example of "go woke, go broke," given it had decided years prior to stop selling products made by MyPillow, whose founder and CEO, Mike Lindell, is a well-known supporter of Donald Trump.

Kristoffer Tripplaar/Sipa via AP Images Bed Bath & Beyond is inaugurating its comeback with the grand opening of a new store in Nashville. The launch is being spearheaded by The Brand House Collective (formerly Kirkland's, Inc.), alongside Beyond Inc., which acquired the intellectual property rights to the Bed Bath & Beyond brand in 2023. "We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today," Amy Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said in an announcement. Brand House Collective hailed the launch as "a reintroduction of one of retail's most iconic names‚Äîlong known for great brands and trusted value." As part of the launch, the company said it will be honoring customers' old Bed Bath & Beyond coupons. Additionally, the first 25 customers to make a purchase at the new location will receive a free "Beyond Bed"‚Äî a "premium 10 [inch] memory foam queen size mattress, regularly valued at $226.99." What People Are Saying Sullivan, CEO of The Brand House Collective, said: "We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today." "This isn't just a store, it's a fresh start for a brand that means something special to so many families," she added. "With Bed Bath & Beyond Home we're delivering on our mission to offer great brands, for any budget, in every room. It's a powerful addition to our portfolio and a meaningful step forward in our transformation." What Happens Next? In June, The Brand House Collective said it planned to expand the Bed Bath & Beyond relaunch through "full-market conversions of existing Kirkland's Home stores." The company told Newsweek that it plans to open four additional locations in the Nashville Market this fall. "We will use our leanings from the market and the voice of the customer to guide future expansion strategies into 2026," it added. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
