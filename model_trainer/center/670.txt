In a new interview, she addressed the viral reaction to her recent hairstyle change and shut down any rumors that she was told to do it by the company. Speaking with Chris Van Vliet on his Insight podcast, the powerhouse of the American Made faction explained the simple reason behind her dramatic transformation. A Viral Hair Debut For years, Ivy Nile has been known for her signature tight boxer braids, a look that perfectly matched her intense, athletic persona. She recently debuted a new style, letting her hair down in long, wavy blonde locks, a change that immediately got the wrestling world talking. "Ever since I debuted in wrestling, it's been just braids," Nile explained. "And you know, I just‚ÄîI don't know. It's just like‚ÄîI just thought of it one day and I did it." She was firm in stating that the decision was hers alone. "No one told me to do braids, by the way," she said. "The braids were my idea, and this was my idea." The change was an immediate hit with fans, a fact Nile proudly noted: "And my hair debut went viral, by the way."

WWE/Getty Images More news: WWE Superstar Announces Retirement Match The Pitbull of Diamond Mine Ivy Nile first rose to prominence in NXT as the sole female member of the Diamond Mine faction. Known as the "Pitbull" of the group, her character was built on her incredible physique, legitimate athletic background, and no-nonsense, submission-based in-ring style. Her braided hair was a key part of that tough, athletic presentation, making her recent style change all the more dramatic. The change in appearance often signals a change in character or a renewed push for a superstar. This has led to widespread fan speculation that Nile could be on the verge of a major storyline. Stepping Up in American Made Nile is currently a member of the American Made faction on Monday Night Raw, alongside The Creed Brothers. The group was led by Chad Gable until he was sidelined with a major rotator cuff injury in June. In Gable's absence, Nile has been forced to step up and has been featured more prominently in backstage segments as the new public face of the group. While she has mostly been in a non-wrestling role on Raw, she did recently compete in the battle royal at the Evolution premium live event. With a bold new look and a more prominent role, the future looks bright for "The Pitbull."
