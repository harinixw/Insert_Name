Lately, Skattebo has been dealing with a tricky hamstring injury, which has sidelined him more often than not. Prior to Thursday's practice session, Skattebo was noticeably absent from the practice session. On Thursday, the rookie running back was seen suited up and putting in some work on the side, as the team went through its training camp session. Skattebo doesn't appear to be fully back in action, but Thursday's appearance was a good sign that suggests he's making progress towards returning. via @SNYGiants: Cam Skattebo is working off to the side at Giants camp today Cam Skattebo is working off to the side at Giants camp today pic.twitter.com/gHVtK99Yn5 ‚Äî Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) August 7, 2025 Although Skattebo has been dealing with his setback, the rookie running back has been having a strong training camp. Like some of the other members of his draft class, Skattebo has received a lot of praise throughout the summer as he's making a case to land some targets and carries during the regular season. Will Skattebo get an opportunity to play in the preseason soon? That's a major question mark heading into Saturday's action against the Buffalo Bills.

Without a bell-cow back in the mix, Skattebo could win the opportunity to share carries in a committee in 2025. First, he has to overcome the injury obstacle.
