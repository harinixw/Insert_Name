The case centered on whether EB-5 applicants must keep their investment "at risk" for longer than the standard two years. The court ruled that they do not, affirming a current U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy and rejecting a legal challenge from a trade group representing regional investment centers. Why It Matters The recent federal court decision regarding the EB-5 immigrant investor program marked a significant shift for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency in the United States. The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential abuse. The ruling could reduce the financial burden and uncertainty for EB-5 visa applicants by clarifying the timeline for how long their investments must remain at-risk. The outcome sets a precedent that could influence thousands of current and future green-card applicants navigating the complexities of U.S. immigration policy. Legal advocacy organizations highlighted the decision as a win for immigrant investors, positioning the case as a touchstone in a broader debate over the balance of program integrity, fairness to individual investors, and economic development goals in the EB-5 program.

Evgenia Parajanian/iStock via Getty Images What To Know A federal judge in Washington ruled in August 2025 that the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022 changed the timeline for how long immigrant investors participating in the EB-5 program must keep their investment "at risk" to qualify for lawful permanent residency. The court found that investors who made their investment after the RIA only need to sustain their capital for two years from the date the capital is placed at risk, not for an indeterminate period linked to later immigration milestones. The lawsuit, brought by Invest in the U.S.A. (IIUSA)‚Äîan association of EB-5 regional centers‚Äîchallenged the interpretation of the RIA by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The IIUSA argued that Congress intended to preserve the pre-existing requirement, which linked the investment period to the adjudication of conditional green card status, sometimes causing investors to have funds tied up for much longer. The American Immigrant Investor Alliance (AIIA), representing the interests of immigrant investors, responded with an amicus brief advocating for a two-year rule consistent with the text of the RIA. In her order, Judge Ana C. Reyes agreed with the government and AIIA, finding that the RIA altered the law's language governing the sustainment period. She stated: "[A]mong its core changes, the RIA altered the INA's language regarding how long investors under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program [EB-5 Program] must keep their money at risk to be eligible for an immigrant visa." This holding is considered a major win for EB-5 investors and undercuts the regional centers' argument that the new law did not change the status quo. Under the decision, EB-5 investments made after the RIA (post-March 2022) will be considered properly sustained if the capital remains at risk for two years from the commencement of the investment period. For earlier (pre-RIA) investors, the old rule remains: The sustainment period begins after obtaining conditional lawful permanent residency and is dependent on immigrant visa bulletin dates. The USCIS is now tasked with drafting new regulations to formally implement these requirements. The process will involve a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), opportunities for public comment, and issuance of final rules, which could take one to two years or more. While the current policy will remain in effect during rulemaking, the exact language of the new rules is yet unknown. What People Are Saying President Donld Trump, in a March 4 speech to a joint session of Congress: "For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on February 25: "So the EB-5 program, was really, you lend some money, but it was all, it was full of nonsense, make believe, and fraud. And it was a way to get a green card that was low priced. So the President said rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program we're going to end the EB-5 program. We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card which is really a Green Card Gold so they'll be able to pay $5 million dollars to the U.S. government." What Happens Next The current USCIS rules on the EB-5 sustainment period remain effective for now, with two-year sustainment for post-RIA investments and the previous standards for earlier investors. USCIS will publish a proposed rule for public comment, followed by final regulations, a process that could extend into 2027. Advocacy organizations have indicated they will continue to participate in this regulatory process and may pursue further legislative reforms in Congress. Is This Article Trustworthy?
