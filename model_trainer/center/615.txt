While it was just a preseason game, Shedeur Sanders received the start and brought a lot of eyes to the game. He was given the start due to the fact that both Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel have been nursing injuries. Sanders, who many thought would be a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, ended up sliding all the way to the fifth round where the Browns traded up to land him. After it was announced by head coach Kevin Stefanski that Sanders would be the starter against the Panthers, questions began swirling about how he would perform in his first NFL game action.

He also ran for 19 yards on four attempts. While there were some slow moments for both Sanders and the offense as a whole, there were plenty of highlight plays as well. Sanders made himself a much more interesting option in the Cleveland four-man quarterback competition. At this point, the Browns are expected to give the Week 1 starting nod to veteran quarterback Joe Flacco. He has been the perceived front-runner to win the job at the beginning of the year, leading up to and throughout training camp. Behind Flacco, Pickett has been viewed as the No. 2 quarterback. Gabriel has been No. 3 on the depth chart. Following tonight's performance, Sanders could start seeing his name being given a better chance to compete for playing time. He showed flashes of the potential that made many project him to be a first-round pick.
