Liga MX giant Tigres UANL could move to the Apertura summit on Friday if the club manages to keep up its winning start to the season at home to a Puebla side that's won just one of its three games this term. Guido Pizarro's men have made the ideal start to the Apertura campaign and have also clinched a top-four finish to advance in the Leagues Cup. Tigres sit third in the Apertura table for the time being, but could climb into the driving seat with a convincing win at the Estadio Universitario this weekend. And it just so happens Los Auriazules have won their last four consecutive meetings with Puebla, going undefeated in this fixture since September 2022. Puebla travels to San Nicolas de los Garza, sitting 14th in the table, having booked a narrow win over Santos Laguna in its most recent Liga MX outing. That's after starting the campaign with back-to-back defeats against Atlas and Mazatlan. Friday's showdown will mark the first meeting between these teams since Pablo Guede took charge of Puebla in December 2024. Guede hasn't managed to beat Tigres in four attempts as a manager to date, drawing three times and losing once to date.
