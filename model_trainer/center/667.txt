Long announced on social media after the news broke that he will take on a new role as the U.S. ambassador to Iceland. Why It Matters The IRS has been roiled by uncertainty since Trump returned to office in January. In addition to a revolving door of agency heads since the president's inauguration‚ÄîLong was the fifth person to helm the tax administration agency in Trump's second term‚Äîthe IRS has also been under tremendous strain after thousands of its employees were either fired or resigned. The reduction in force was part of a broader Trump administration initiative, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. The push by Trump and Elon Musk drew widespread condemnation over the administration's slash-and-burn approach to shrinking the bureaucracy. Mass layoffs and removals at the IRS have also raised concerns about its ability to process tax returns and refunds.

Then-Representative Billy Long speaks during the House Republican freshmen news conference marking the first day that "all non-exempt employers are required to provide health care coverage that includes abortion-inducing drugs or else pay a steep tax" on August 1, 2012. More CQ Roll Call via AP Images What To Know Long's removal comes less than two months after he was confirmed to lead the federal agency. Bessent will take over as the head of the IRS on an acting basis, a White House official told AP. The Republican-led Senate confirmed Long 53-44 despite Democratic senators' concerns about Long's lack of experience in tax administration and his past work for a firm that pitched a fraudulent pandemic-era tax break. Before being confirmed as IRS commissioner, Long served as a Republican in Congress, where he supported legislation to abolish the tax agency, a move championed by many others in the GOP. Five people have served as IRS commissioner, either on a permanent or acting basis, since Trump took office: Douglas O'Donnell, Melanie Krause, Gary Shapley, Michael Faulkender and Long. O'Donnell took over leading the agency on January 21, after his predecessor, Danny Werfel, announced he would leave before Trump was inaugurated. Krause accepted a deferred resignation offer from the IRS after the agency reached a deal with the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants' tax data. Shapley was replaced after his appointment set off a fight between Musk and Bessent. Long will be the the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862, according to AP. What People Are Saying Billy Long, on X on Friday: "It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!" What Happens Next Bessent will serve as acting IRS commissioner while the administration weighs a permanent replacement. The Associated Press contributed reporting to this article.
