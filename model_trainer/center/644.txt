"I am proud of the unrelenting law enforcement effort this week to find and arrest Michael Paul Brown," Attorney General Austin Knudsen said in a statement sent out to reporters. "The support we've seen for the community of Anaconda from across the state and the nation has also been remarkable," Knudsen said. "The families and friends of the victims remain in my prayers." What Happened in Anaconda, Montana? The shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. August 1 in the Owl Bar, resulting in the deaths of a bartender and three patrons, police said. The victims were identified as Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64; Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; David Allen Leach, 70; and Tony Wayne Palm, 74. Brown immediately fled, leading to a manhunt, according to authorities.

Joseph Scheller/The Montana Standard via AP Who Is Montana Shooting Suspect Michael Paul Brown? Brown, 45, lived next door to the Owl Bar in Anaconda. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County police named him as the suspect in the shooting around 2 p.m. on the day of the killings. In a post to Facebook, law enforcement advised that Brown was "believed to be armed and dangerous." According to a U.S. Marshal notice issued last week, Brown is a veteran of the U.S. Army who was deployed to Iraq in 2004 and 2005. Upon leaving the Army, he joined the Montana National Guard, where he remained from 2006 to 2009. Authorities reported that he had been seen heading west into Stump Town and disappeared into a wooded area, where law enforcement conducted its search. Brown's niece Clare Boyle told the Associated Press that Brown had struggled with mental illness for years. Where Was Michael Paul Brown Apprehended? Multiple law enforcement agencies conducted a thorough search for Brown across the area, and Knudsen earlier this week said that it did not appear that he had broken into any homes or cabins to get food or supplies. The search covered around 22 square miles of forest, which authorities closed off to public access. Authorities found and detained Brown about 2 p.m. Friday. He remains in custody of the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County authorities. Knudsen and other officials will hold a news conference Friday evening to provide further details.
