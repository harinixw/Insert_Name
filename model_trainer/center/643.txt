Detroit Lions vs Atlanta Falcons - NFL Preseason Week 1 Detroit Lions vs Atlanta Falcons - NFL Preseason Week 1 Coley Cleary How to Watch Lions vs Falcons Date: Friday, August 8, 2025 Time: 7:00 PM ET Channel: Lions TV Network (Detroit), WAGA-FOX 5 (Atlanta), NBC (WALB-Albany, GA) Stream: Fubo (TRY FOR FREE) The wait is finally over as the NFL preseason is officially here, and these two squads continue their preparation for their opening games of the regular season during this matchup. We likely will not see many of the stars in action, as all of Jared Goff, Bijan Robinson, and Jahmyr Gibbs will almost certainly get the night off. However, there are still plenty of storylines to follow. The biggest thing to keep an eye on if you are a Detroit fan is whether or not the offense can move the ball in this game. It is only the preseason, but the 7 points the Lions scored in their opening 27-point loss to the Chargers are a slight cause for concern. Detroit will not have Ben Johnson calling the plays this season, and they also lost defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn this offseason, so they may need to work out the kinks over the next few weeks This is a great NFL matchup that you will not want to miss; make sure to tune in and catch all the action. This is not a nationally broadcast game, but it can still be live-streamed locally with Fubo on the Lions TV Network (Detroit), WAGA-FOX 5 (Atlanta), and NBC (WALB-Albany, GA). It will be aired via tape delay later on NFL Network. Live stream Lions vs Falcons for free with Fubo: Start your subscription now! Regional restrictions may apply.
