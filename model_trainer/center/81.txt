Mason on Bartley future and Maja update Image source, Getty Images Published 8 August 2025 West Bromwich Albion boss Ryan Mason said that newly retired Kyle Bartley will "hopefully" still have a future with the Baggies. The defender announced his retirement on Friday after struggling with a knee injury. "He's been incredible for this football club, on the pitch and off it. He's a real leader, a real man," Mason told BBC Radio WM. "He's got a great club here that are with him and support him and are going to be on this next chapter with him. Hopefully, he can still add something to this club." Mason also confirmed that striker Josh Maja is fit and available for selection - though it is not a given the Nigeria international will feature in Saturday's match at home to Blackburn Rovers (15:00 BST). "We know Josh's situation. He had a very long time out," Mason added. "We are just trying to make sure we can get him to a point where he can help us throughout the season."
