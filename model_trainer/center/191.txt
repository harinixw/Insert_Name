Known as the “King of Hair” and one of the few Black salon owners in Beverly Hills, Charles has styled icons from Gabrielle Union and Serena Williams to Diahann Carroll and built a multimillion-dollar career rooted in both artistry and business acumen.

Contestants will vie for a $25,000 grant and licensing rights to one of his salons, with challenges designed to test not only technical skills but also the entrepreneurial know-how essential for long-term success. “You can be a jack of all trades, but you have to master one,” Charles says. “And you need the business skills — the LLC, the trademark, the customer service — to match. Longevity in this industry is about more than hair. It’s about people, professionalism, and persistence.” His emphasis on fundamentals comes at a pivotal timem, especially for young Black stylists. Disgruntled customers have taken to social media to share their unpleasant beauty service experiences online. The top frustrations? Last-minute cancellations, lack of time management, and inconsistent quality. From Apprenticeship to Entrepreneurial Leadership Dezi Santiago understands those concerns intimately. Raised in Detroit and trained through rigorous apprenticeships, she transitioned from stylist to entrepreneur after spotting gaps in the systems and service standards at salons where she worked.

Her beauty brand, Biomni, grew out of a need for high-performing, non-toxic products suitable for diverse textures, and now includes a cult-favorite hair mask, shampoo, and leave-in conditioner. “This is not a hustle — it’s corporate,” Santiago says. “Your clients are paying for your lifestyle. Respect their time, respect their hair, and set up your business right from the start.” Beyond the Brush: Building Business Savvy While Charles and Santiago focus on bridging artistry with entrepreneurship, Tamara Taylor approaches the challenge from another angle: management and infrastructure. As founder of Mastermind Mgmt, a talent management firm for hair, makeup, and wardrobe artists, she saw firsthand how many creatives excel at their craft but falter in areas like entity formation, tax compliance, and contract negotiation. Tamara Taylor, founder of Mastermind Mgmt and Mastermind Matters Tamara Taylor Her nonprofit initiative, Mastermind Matters, offers workshops on foundational business practices — from protecting intellectual property to tracking expenses and building credit. “People talk about making money, but not about maintaining it,” Taylor says. “I’ve seen multi–six-figure earners unable to work high-profile jobs because their paperwork wasn’t in order. My goal is to make sure artists are set up for the opportunities they deserve.” A Shared Mission Across their different paths, all three leaders share a belief that the next generation of Millennial and Gen Z stylists must reclaim a culture of excellence — one that marries skill, professionalism, and smart business practices. As Charles puts it, “It’s time to pass it on.” Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER... FORBES’ FEATURED Video
