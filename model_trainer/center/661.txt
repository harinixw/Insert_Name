However, this injury doesn't impact his swing, so Judge is able to slot in as the designated hitter for Aaron Boone's Yankees. This move slides Giancarlo Stanton out of the lineup, but Boone was seemingly considering playing Stanton in the outfield while Judge isn't able to throw.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 5: Giancarlo Stanton #27 of the New York Yankees high fives manager Aaron Boone #17 after defeating the Detroit Tigers 5-1 during a game at Yankee Stadium on September 5, 2023 in New York City. More Rich Schultz/Getty Images During Judge's first four games back from the injured list, he's been the DH, and Stanton has sat on the bench. With the Yankees scheduled to face Houston Astros lefty Framber Valdez on Saturday, Boone made the announcement that there was a "good chance" Stanton would be in the outfield for the Yankees when they matched up with Valdez. "Some range is going to be limited, obviously, but I do feel like he'll make the plays that need to be made," Boone said regarding what he expects from Stanton in the outfield. Stanton, 35, hasn't played in the outfield since 2023. The veteran has suffered numerous leg injuries throughout his career that have crippled his mobility. However, with the Yankees needing right-handed bats in their lineup against a southpaw, it seems Stanton will return to the outfield. The expectations on the veteran slugger shouldn't be high. It's unlikely he's going to play very well in the outfield because of his limited range and mobility. However, he was once a solid defensive outfielder, so the balls hit right at him shouldn't be any sort of issue.
