Texas GOP unleashes hellfire on Democrat deserters
« The suicidal impulses of leftist Jews XPost Print Email August 9, 2025 Texas GOP unleashes hellfire on Democrat deserters By Amil Imani Texas is under siege, not by invaders, but by gutless Democrats who fled like rats from a sinking ship, abandoning their posts to sabotage a righteous redistricting mission. More than 50 Democrat lawmakers bolted the state, cowering in Illinois and New York to block a Republican-led congressional map that would cement the will of Texas voters -- 56% of whom roared for Donald Trump in 2024. Governor Greg Abbott, a titan of resolve, has drawn his sword, vowing to hammer these traitors with “special session after special session after special session” until they’re crushed under the weight of their own cowardice. This is war, and the Texas GOP is a strike force that will not yield. These Democrat cowards, led by the spineless Gene Wu, think they can paralyze the state House by denying it a quorum. Their flight is a betrayal of every Texan who expects their elected officials to stand and fight, not scurry to safe havens like roaches dodging sunlight. Abbott’s response is a thunderclap: civil arrest warrants are ready to be issued, prepared to bring these deserters back to face justice. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a fierce advocate himself, has launched a legal assault, filing a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court to remove Wu and his allies from their seats for breaking their oaths. Paxton’s X post on August 8, 2025, labeled these runaways “rogue legislators,” calling for their immediate arrest and initiating an investigation into potential bribery by shadowy groups like Texas Majority PAC. The GOP’s iron grip is tight, and it will crush this rebellion. The redistricting plan is no mere map -- it’s a battle standard for Texas Republicans. It will secure 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from 25, ensuring the voice of Trump’s legion resonates in Washington. Abbott’s justification is ironclad: a federal appeals court ruling and the 2024 election results demand this correction. Republican voters, trapped in Democrat-drawn districts, will finally be liberated. This isn’t gerrymandering -- it’s justice, aligning the map with the raw will of the people. Democrats scream “corruption,” but their words are hollow, drowned out by their own hypocrisy. After all, they did flee to Illinois. Blue states like Illinois, with its 14-3 Democrat stranglehold, and Massachusetts, with zero Republican voices, have gerrymandered their maps into fortresses of liberal dominance. Abbott called them out, exposing their sham outrage as a desperate ploy to deflect from their own sins. The Democrats’ exodus isn’t just a political stunt -- it’s a knife in the back of flood-ravaged Texans. The special session, meant to deliver critical relief to central Texas victims, is frozen because these quitters chose self-preservation over service. Abbott’s righteous fury burns bright: “These Democrats are denying aid to their constituents,” he thundered, branding them derelict and unfit. Their absence stalls not just redistricting but the very lifeline their voters need. This is treason against the people, and Texans will not forgive their betrayal. Nationally, this fight is a powder keg. Trump’s endorsement propels the GOP’s effort, positioning Texas as the leader in a redistricting battle to secure the House for 2026. Democrat governors like Gavin Newsom threaten to respond with their own maps, but their words are ineffective. Their states’ redistricting processes are limited by committees and commissions, unlike Texas, where Abbott uses executive power decisively. Illinois’s map, a distorted image of fairness, exposes the Democrats’ strategy: rig the game, then cry foul when the GOP fights back. Texas will not yield to its double standards. The Texas Supreme Court looms as the final battlefield. Abbott’s lawsuit against Wu argues that quorum-breaking hands a third of House Democrats the power to dictate law for all Texans -- an abomination that must be crushed. Wu’s pathetic defense, claiming his flight fulfills his oath, is a lie spat in the face of every Texan. The court will see through this charade, and when it rules, these deserters will face the reckoning they’ve earned. Their seats will be vacated, their influence obliterated, and their names etched in infamy as the cowards who fled when duty called. This is the Texas GOP’s finest hour. Abbott and Paxton are not just leaders -- they’re avengers, using every tool at their disposal to restore order. The Democrats’ flight is a desperate gasp from a struggling opposition, clutching to obstruction as their last resort. But Texas is built in fire, not fear. These runaways will be tracked down, their plans uncovered, and their power taken away. The redistricting map will be approved, flood relief will arrive, and the GOP will push forward, strong and steady. Texans want fighters, not cowardly whisperers, and the Republican machine will deliver. The Democrats’ surrender is near -- they can run, but they can’t escape the fury of a state united under the banner of strength, loyalty, and victory. Amil Imani lives in Texas.
