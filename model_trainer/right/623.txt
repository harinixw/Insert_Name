White House pushes for PragerU to replace government videos in schools By WND Staff August 8, 2025 With the end of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, thanks to the recission bill passed by Congress, which effectively defunded CPB, the Trump administration is reportedly pushing for PragerU to replace previous educational TV in government schools – something that’s already happening in some states. PragerU is a video-based provider of educational material for children and adults founded by conservative talk-show host Dennis Prager. According to Vox, Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon recently introduced a partnership with the provider, confirmed by PragerU CEO Marissa Streit. The partnership has already created new material for an exhibit at the White House’ new Founders Museum. There are at least eight states that have gone to PragerU for educational material, Vox reported. CPB Shutdown, PragerU Leave a Comment You must be logged in to post a comment.
