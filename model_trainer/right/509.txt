During the era of former head coach Tom Herman, the Texas Longhorns‚Äò locker room being renovated was a huge deal. You had the photos of Herman destroying the old lockers with a sledgehammer, the price tag of $8,700 per locker, it all had Austin in a frenzy. But that was eight years ago, which has led the Longhorns to regenerate some of that hype with an updated locker room. And holy moly, what a glorious update they got. Rather than have their current head coach Steve Sarkisian demolish the old lockers like Herman did, they auctioned them off back in May which gave the green light for the renovation process to start. And get this: Every locker has a power reclining chair featured, which is by far the coolest thing of the locker. And to top it off, they have their own drawers and cabinets.
