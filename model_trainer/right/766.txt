The EV charging initiative, part of former president Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has built just 384 charging ports at 68 stations in 16 states as of April 2025, Reuters reported after reviewing the GAO's report. The figure amounts to less than 0.2 percent of the roughly 219,000 public EV charging ports operating nationwide. "Wider adoption of [electric] vehicles may be slowed because there aren't enough chargers available across the country," the GAO wrote in its summary of the report, noting that the program's oversight office "has not defined performance goals with measurable targets and time frames for its activities." Under Biden and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation intended the program to build half a million charging stations by 2030. The initiative was widely criticized, including by some Democrats. As of last year, only seven charging stations were operating, a situation that Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) called "pathetic." "We're now three years into this. â€¦ That is a vast administrative failure," Merkley said last June. "Something is terribly wrong and it needs to be fixed." Since retaking office, President Donald Trump has signed executive orders reversing the Biden administration's electric-vehicle policies, including the charging station initiative, prompting a lawsuit from mostly Democratic-leaning states. A federal judge in June ordered that the Trump administration restore electric-vehicle funding to most of the states that sued.
