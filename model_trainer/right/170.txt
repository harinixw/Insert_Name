I thought he made good decisions,‚Äù head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters, according to Pro Football Talk. ‚ÄúOperation-wise there are some things we want to be a little cleaner on. Throwing the ball accurately, throwing it on time, and then when it wasn‚Äôt there, extending plays with his legs, I thought was really cool.‚Äù The third-round pick finished sixth in Heisman voting as a redshirt sophomore in 2023 after throwing 23 touchdowns to just six interceptions and running for an additional 12 touchdowns.
