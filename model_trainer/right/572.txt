Dunn disclosed in her closed door testimony Thursday to the House Oversight Committee that the test was refused due to offering no political advantage, the source stated.

Dunn also stated that the former president’s team opted not to do a Super Bowl interview because of information revealed in the February 2024 Department of Justice (DOJ) Special Counsel Robert Hur report, the source told the Caller. In her opening statement, she claimed Biden remains mentally sharp and fully capable of carrying out his responsibilities. “While I observed that President Biden aged physically during his time in office, which is something that happens to every President, he remained throughout my interactions with him fully engaged and clear in his directions and supervision,” Dunn’s statement read.

Dunn also claimed she was unaware of Biden’s stutter until it was reported by the media in 2020, despite allegedly knowing Biden since the 1980s, the source told the Caller. Previously, Dunn served as a senior advisor to the Biden-Harris campaign, where she guided messaging, debate prep and overall strategy, according to her Wall Street Journal (WSJ) bio.
