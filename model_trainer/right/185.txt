Showy bride’s surprise performance at Las Vegas ceremony chases ‘shy’ groom away ‘He was calling for help’
Sex & Relationships Showy bride’s surprise performance at Las Vegas ceremony chases ‘shy’ groom away: ‘He was calling for help’ By Caroline Cubbin Published Aug. 8, 2025, 3:50 p.m. ET Here comes the bride — and off goes the groom! Singer and content creator Ortal Edri shared a video on TikTok of her Las Vegas ceremony that took place at Graceland Wedding Chapel, which included a live performance of her singing Elvis Presley’s famous hit “Can’t Help Falling in Love” and Mariah Carey’s “My All.” Between the bride’s bold vocals and the Elvis impersonator jamming out — this was enough of a scene to send the “camera-shy” groom disappearing in the background, which has left people online feeling some type of way. @ortaledri Surprising my shy husband with his favorite Elvis song at our Vegas wedding ended up Elvis enjoyed it more 😭 #canthelpfallinginlove #elvis #wedding #elvispresley ♬ original sound – Ortal Edri In the caption, Edri explains that she surprised her “shy husband” with his favorite Elvis song, but she says that she had to “chase him down the chapel because he disappeared” on her.

Combine that with the pressure and all the excitement. As for what was going through his mind — probably not much in that exact moment. He just went with what he was feeling.” She also said that the awkward vibe was mostly due to the last-minute marriage ceremony. “The truth is, from the moment Shamir proposed until the wedding itself, everything happened so fast,” the bride said in the interview, revealing that her fiancé proposed only a short few days before they said “I do” in Sin City. The video saw Edri dragging her husband-to-be back into the hot seat. Ortal Edri, / TikTok Watching the cringeworthy video was enough to send people straight to the comment section to share their unsolicited opinions. Others wondered why the ceremony was so empty, but the bride said four days’ notice didn’t leave families and friends a ton of time to fly in for the affair. Ortal Edri, / TikTok “I understand you’re getting married, but is he?” wondered one TikTok user, while another wrote: “Imagine being shy and your wife comes out here hooting and hollering.” “The phone in his hand like he was calling for help, but it was too late,” said a commiserating commenter, prompting another reply to offer a helping hand: “Bro, blink twice if you need help.” While some users busied themselves over-analyzing the duo’s dynamic and celebrating the bride’s confidence, a majority of TikTok comments attempted to summon popular comedy creator Madison Humphrey, who swifty recreated a parody of the viral moment — with Edri’s superimposed vocals. @madison.humphreyy The fact that @Ortal Edri RE-RECORDED VOCALS for this!!!!! One of my favorite parodies yet!!!!! (& huge thank you to the Abbey Chapel for letting us film here!) #fyp #comedy #couplescomedy ♬ original sound – Madison Humphrey Despite all the noise, Edri maintains that she and her husband loved their spontaneous Sin City ceremony, and some viewers did concede in the comments that her songs were a sweet gesture — they certainly indicated her “Burning Love” for him in true Elvis fashion. As nervewracking nuptials go, this awkward watch barely skims the surface. At the very least, Edri didn’t have a wedding cake smashed in her face by a moody mother-in-law like another recent bride — though the buttercream-laden bride’s new hubby also seemed to flee the scene, much like the Sin City singer’s.
