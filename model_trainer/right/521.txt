Editorial Vanderbilt‚Äôs Diego Pavia Makes Asinine National Title Statement That Will Age Terribly This Season BLOG (Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo/Getty Images) Andrew Powell Sports and Entertainment Blogger August 08, 2025 3:49 PM ET August 08, 2025 3:49 PM ET Andrew Powell Sports and Entertainment Blogger Font Size: LMAO ‚Ä¶ give me a break, man. Diego Pavia, the quarterback of the Vanderbilt Commodores, is completely out of his mind going into the new college football campaign. Pavia came into the spotlight in the 2024 season after Vandy landed a surprising upset victory against Alabama, 40-35, in Nashville, Tennessee. When it comes to the history of college football, it was definitely one of the largest upsets that we‚Äôve seen in some time. With that being said though, the Commodores were just ‚Äúeh‚Äù for the remainder of the year, finishing things up with a 7-6 record. (RELATED: West Virginia‚Äôs Rich Rodriguez Blasts Society As ‚ÄòSoft,‚Äô And He‚Äôs Not Wrong) For Vandy, sure, it wasn‚Äôt a bad year. But it‚Äôs nothing like the national championships that Pavia speaks of. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs awesome when you see a young player have a lot of confidence, especially a quarterback. But there‚Äôs a thin line between confidence and just being cocky, and I don‚Äôt know what side you want to sway him in with his latest statement, but one thing is clear: He‚Äôs out of his damn mind! Because get this: He actually believes Vanderbilt can win the national championship this season. Yes, seriously. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve got the tools (offensively) and defensively to put our foot forward and win the national championship,‚Äù said Pavia while speaking with Paul Finebaum in an interview Wednesday, per AL.com.
