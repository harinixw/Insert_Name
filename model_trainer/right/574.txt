Opinion ROOKE: French President Takes Page From Trump‚Äôs Playbook, Targets Key Privilege For Country‚Äôs Diplomats OPINION Photo by SEBASTIEN BOZON/AFP via Getty Images Mary Rooke Commentary and Analysis Writer August 07, 2025 5:47 PM ET August 07, 2025 5:47 PM ET Mary Rooke Commentary and Analysis Writer Font Size: When President Donald Trump sees that another country is treating the U.S. or its citizens with disrespect, he immediately takes direct action to put pressure on them. It seems that French President Emmanuel Macron has seen the success Trump has had and wants in on the action. Now, I don‚Äôt expect you to know the background story of why France and Algeria don‚Äôt get along. However, the history between the two countries dates back centuries, including a long period of French control starting in 1830 and a bloody war of independence that ended in 1962. Since then, diplomatic and migration issues have plagued the two countries. However, things took a turn for the worse in July 2024 when Macron joined several other countries, including the U.S., in recognizing Morocco‚Äôs sovereignty over Western Sahara.

Algeria is also holding French-Algerian author Boualem Sansal and reporter Christophe Gleizes in prison for ‚Äúundermining national unity‚Äù and ‚Äúadvocating terrorism‚Äù respectively, Politico reported. üá´üá∑üá©üáø President Emmanuel Macron urged a tougher line from Paris in an intensifying standoff with former north African colony Algeria, saying France‚Äôs stance needed to ‚Äòcommand respect‚Äô.

(ROOKE: One Of The Largest School Districts In Country Was Failing For Years. Then Republicans Took Over) The French president instructed his prime minister and foreign minister to terminate the 2013 agreement that granted Algerian diplomats free access to France, Politico reported. ‚ÄúWe have no choice but to adopt a firmer approach,‚Äù Macron told French outlet Le Figaro. If this had happened in the U.S., Trump would have likely used the full weight of the U.S. economic and diplomatic machine to put Algeria in its place. Similar to how Trump has used tariffs to force Mexico and Canada to comply with border crossings and drug enforcement. Maybe during Macron‚Äôs last visit to the White House, Trump lent him a piece of his backbone. Follow Mary Rooke on X: @MaryRooke Sign up for Mary Rooke‚Äôs weekly newsletter here!
