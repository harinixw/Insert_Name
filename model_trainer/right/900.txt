Burn Notice Russia Hoax Secrets Found in FBI Burn Bags
Archives Home → Articles XPost Print Email August 6, 2025 Burn Notice: Russia Hoax Secrets Found in FBI Burn Bags By Charlton Allen They didn’t just bury the truth. They sealed it in burn bags and locked it away inside FBI headquarters—marked for destruction before detection. But one man asked the right questions, found the right room, and uncovered the evidence before it went up in smoke. That’s right. The most consequential political scandal of a generation—the Russia Hoax—consumed the Democrat party, Never Trumpers, and the legacy media. Its narrative became a creed for the political left, even after it was debunked and discredited. Yet it lingers still, a scaffold upon which they project their hatred of all things Trump. And now we know: evidence that could unravel their narrative wasn’t just buried—it was bagged for destruction at FBI headquarters. Draw your own conclusions. The picture paints itself. For years, the question wasn’t just what they knew, but what they hid. Now we have the answer—more damning than imagined. In three earlier articles, I exposed how the Obama administration manipulated assessments, sidelined dissenting analysts, and buried the Clinton campaign’s ties to Russian disinformation beneath layers of narrative management. The last chapter traced the final bureaucratic deception that culminated in the January 6th intelligence report—how the doctored ICA, the suppression of Clinton-linked intel, and the media’s willing complicity helped cement a false consensus that never matched the underlying intelligence. But this brings us to the darker sequel: physical concealment and premeditated destruction. We’ve seen something like this before—think Enron, except this time it’s not corporate auditors under fire, but the previous senior leadership of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and beyond. The Obama-era coup against Donald Trump didn’t begin with Crossfire Hurricane, and it certainly didn’t end with the Mueller Report—or even with the last burn bag recovered. Who knows if it has ended or if it ever will? With each passing day, new documents surface. Each one damning. And those desperate to bury the scandal only dig themselves deeper. Analysis of the burn bag documents begins with a record certain officials likely prayed would stay buried: the so-called “Durham annex.” Omitted from the public version of Special Counsel John Durham’s report, it wasn’t excluded due to irrelevance—but because it didn’t address misconduct during the investigation. Instead, it exposed the intelligence abuses that triggered the investigation itself. Until recently, it remained classified. As FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X, his team uncovered a hidden room of previously unseen documents—including a classified Durham annex from the Trump–Russia probe—and initiated a coordinated declassification review with other intelligence leaders. In Patel’s own words: “We just uncovered burn bags/room filled with Russiagate files, including the Durham annex, and declassified them. Once again, I released the prior FBI’s own documents and exposed the truth.” On July 31, 2025, the annex Patel uncovered was officially declassified and released by Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. While redacted in parts, it confirms the intelligence community possessed credible foreign intelligence raising red flags about the Clinton campaign's involvement in fueling the Trump–Russia disinformation narrative. It further documents that this intelligence was seen by top officials—including those who drafted and approved the January 2017 ICA—but withheld from its conclusions. Even a cursory review of the Durham annex reveals explosive new information—evidence that helps stitch together the real collusion behind the Russia hoax. And it wasn’t Trump and Moscow. It was the Clinton campaign, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, operatives from George Soros’ network, and political actors embedded within the intelligence community and the FBI—all under the watchful eyes of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The implications of Patel’s discovery and Grassley’s declassification are staggering—but they barely scratch the surface of what the annex actually reveals. That story—the memos, the names, and the strategy they buried—deserves its own reckoning. And it’s coming next. But first, did the concealment and intended destruction of these records violate federal law? Here’s a quick digest: 18 U.S.C. § 2071 – Concealment or destruction of federal records This statute makes it a crime to remove, destroy, or hide federal records deliberately. That includes anything from official memos to internal investigative documents. A conviction can carry up to three years in prison, and—critically—can bar the offender from holding public office. 18 U.S.C. § 1519 – Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations Applies to anyone who “knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record… with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.” Penalty: up to 20 years in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 1505 – Obstruction of proceedings before Congress or federal agencies Covers efforts to influence, obstruct, or impede proceedings before departments, agencies, or Congress, using threats, force, intimidation, or corrupt persuasion, with knowledge of a pending proceeding or a foreseeable agency action. In this case, if senior officials knew these materials were responsive to congressional or DOJ inquiries—and ordered them placed into destruction queues anyway—then “corrupt persuasion” under the statute could apply. Concealing or routing those records for destruction, outside the normal redaction or archival procedures, may constitute a deliberate attempt to obstruct lawful oversight or pending investigations. Penalty: up to 5 years in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 1924 – Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents Criminalizes improper retention of classified documents by government officials, including knowingly removing such materials without authority and failing to return them to proper custody. This is a highly fact-specific analysis that could result in successful criminal prosecution if the elements of the crime are met. Penalty: up to 5 years in prison. 18 U.S.C. § 793(f)–(g) – Espionage Act: gross negligence and conspiracy involving national defense information Penalizes grossly negligent handling of national defense-related classified materials, including failure to report their loss or destruction. Covers conspiracies to commit any such offense. Penalty: up to 10 years in prison. The Russia hoax was the most elaborate disinformation campaign ever unleashed on American soil—not by a foreign adversary, but by our security-intelligence apparatus, acting under the direction of the Executive Branch to target the Republican nominee who would go on to become president. These documents weren’t just misfiled or overlooked—they were queued for destruction and placed in burn bags. Marked for disappearance and discovered only by chance, and only because someone refused to stop digging. In a functioning republic, someone should be indicted. And maybe—eventually—someone will be. But even now, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The truth has finally been declassified. But the damage was done long before: a presidency sabotaged, intelligence corrupted, and public trust in government left in ashes. This wasn’t just a coup. It was a cover-up stuffed in a burn bag—and they nearly struck the match. It confirms what Donald Trump saw all along: the fire behind the smoke. And now, the rest of us can see it too. Stay tuned.
