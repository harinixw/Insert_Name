WATCH Timon Cline: 75 years of anti-Christian law started with this one Supreme Court case By WND Staff August 6, 2025 What if everything you’ve been told about the First Amendment is a lie? In this explosive interview, Elizabeth Farah sits down with attorney and scholar Timon Cline to expose the 1947 Everson v. Board of Education decision as the legal nuke that detonated America’s religious foundations. Cline calls Everson the Roe v. Wade of public religion: 75 years of Supreme Court rulings that erased school prayer, banned Ten Commandments displays, and silenced Christian expression, all in the name of “neutrality.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

With over 60% of Americans still identifying as Christian, why are courts treating religion like a threat? Cline lays out a strategy to overturn Everson, restore federalism, and give states back the right to support public faith. If you care about religious liberty, parental rights, and reclaiming American identity, this is the moment you’ve been waiting for.
