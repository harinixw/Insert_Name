Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, would replace Gov. Adriana Kugler, who steps down Friday. The post carries a vote on the Fed’s rate-setting committee, which Trump has pressured to cut borrowing costs. If confirmed, Miran would serve through Jan. 31, 2026 while the administration searches for a permanent nominee.

A Harvard-trained economist and former Treasury official, Miran now steers the three-member Council of Economic Advisers. If confirmed by the Senate, he could be on the dais for the Fed’s Sept. 16-17 meeting, marking Trump’s first imprint on the Board in his second term. This is a developing story and will be updated accordingly.
