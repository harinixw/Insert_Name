Baltimore Ravens legend Terrell Suggs was arrested after brandishing a gun at a Starbucks drive-thru in Scottsdale last year, and a dashcam caught it all. The former NFL star was at the establishment on March 10, 2024, when the owner of the dashcam claimed that Suggs had backed his own vehicle into the victim's. There was no damage. The footage from the dashcam, obtained by TMZ Sports, showed Suggs and the driver arguing outside their vehicles, inspecting any potential damage. Police said at the time that when Suggs left, he flipped off the driver and yelled obscenities.

(Aaron Doster/ USA Today Sports) After more than a couple of minutes, Suggs was seen getting his order, and the driver pulled up closer. Suggs continued to speak to the driver from his own car before holding a gun outside the driver's side window. At that point, the driver called 911 as Suggs drove off. Suggs' rep, Denise White, told TMZ that Suggs never hit the other car, and that Suggs had felt that the other driver would follow him, "causing Terrell to feel threatened." That led to Suggs showing his gun, making it "clear that he was prepared to protect himself if necessary." "Arizona is an open-carry state, and Terrell is aware of the responsibilities that come with firearm ownership. He recognizes that he should not have displayed his weapon, but his actions were solely in response to feeling threatened and were not intended to escalate the situation further," White said, adding that Suggs had never pointed the gun at the driver.
