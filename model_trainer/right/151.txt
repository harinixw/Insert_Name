Every hunt, every flight, and in the everyday moments of life, I’ll feel your presence,” Shelby told his late sibling. “And although it may annoy you, you’ll have to watch me do it all just a little better, a little smoother, and —let’s be honest— looking far more handsome than you ever could in the process. 😏.” 21 The Blackstock brothers at an elegant family event.
