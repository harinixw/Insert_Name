The Hill pointed out that a third Trooper on scene was able to save the first two. The woman who had called police about the situation had been shot too, and was pronounced dead at the scene. WINK noted that the alleged shooter was the woman’s neighbor. CNN quoted police indicating, “The suspect was armed with a rifle, refused to comply with commands, and was ultimately shot and killed during the incident.” Both wounded Troopers are in stable condition.
