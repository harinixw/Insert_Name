Marlow: How the Conservative Grassroots Can Save the Country from Lawfare 130 Breitbart TV 7 Aug 2025 On Thursday’s “Alex Marlow Show,” host and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow talked about lawfare. Marlow said, “We’re not just going to be able to magically remove the threat of lawfare all at once. … But the one thing that we can do is that we can identify that the real problem for the American judicial system right now…there [are] just too many liberals on the bench. … And how are we going to defeat them, a strong conservative movement…staying activated in off election years.” Marlow’s new book, Breaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself. “The Alex Marlow Show,” hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.
