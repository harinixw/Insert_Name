Police believe she may have been meeting up with a group of friends she met on the online chat group Discord. “The note indicated the people would not provide her with their true names, and it does not appear that Katie met these people prior to her being missing,” the press release said. Hong’s uncle, James Han, told ABC 7 News that her family is “absolutely devastated.” “My brother-in-law and sister-in-law have been absolutely devastated,” Han said. “It has been very hard on all of us.” Advertisement Lt. Calvin Tang told ABC 7 that Hong, who enjoys playing video games, also appeared to be holding a computer monitor when she was filmed on surveillance video. “Learning what she plays, how she plays, how she interacts with other users is a key factor in this investigation,” Tang said. Hong’s uncle has set up a GoFundMe so that her parents can take leaves of absence from work to dedicate themselves to searching for their daughter.
