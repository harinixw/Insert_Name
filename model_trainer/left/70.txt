Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court To Lift Restrictions On Southern California Immigration Stops The petition comes after an appeals court refused to lift the temporary restraining order restricting what factors authorities can use to make stops and arrests in Los Angeles. AP Aug 7, 2025, 05:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADINGERROR LOADING WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order restricting immigration stops that swept up at least two U.S. citizens in Southern California. The emergency petition comes after an appeals court refused to lift the temporary restraining order restricting what factors authorities can use to make stops and arrests in the Los Angeles area. Advertisement Judge Maame E. Frimpong found there was a “mountain of evidence” that federal immigration enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. Her ruling came in a lawsuit filed by immigrant advocacy groups who accused President Donald Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. The Justice Department asked the justices to immediately halt Frimpong’s order, arguing it hinders their enforcement of immigration law. Department of Homeland Security attorneys say immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. 20 Years OfFreeJournalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
