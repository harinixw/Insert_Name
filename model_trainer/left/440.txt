The president blamed Joe Biden for selecting Jerome Powell as the U.S. Central Bank head when it was in fact him who made the appointment.
President Donald Trump was raging against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the Oval Office on Wednesday when he appeared to forget he was the one who put him in charge. The president, 79, has been complaining for months about the head of the central bank for failing to cut interest rates. During his rant, Trump pulled one of the his favorite moves by blaming former President Joe Biden while blasting Powell being in office. “He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” the president vented. “I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him.” However, it was Trump who appointed Powell to lead the Federal Reserve during his first term. In his Nov. 2017 announcement, the president praised Powell’s leadership, judgement and expertise.
