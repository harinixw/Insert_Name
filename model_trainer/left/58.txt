Rodriguez via Getty Images LOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî Actor Gina Carano has settled her federal lawsuit against Lucasfilm and its parent The Walt Disney Co. over her claim that she was fired from ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù in 2021 for expressing right-wing views on social media. The specific terms of the agreement were not made available. ‚ÄúMs. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect,‚Äù Lucasfilm said in a statement. ‚ÄúWith this lawsuit concluded, we look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future.‚Äù Advertisement The two sides stipulated in a federal court filing Thursday that the case should be dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can‚Äôt be refiled. A judge still needs to formally dismiss it. The case had been scheduled to go to trial in Los Angeles in February of next year. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California last year, alleged Carano was wrongfully terminated from the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù galaxy Disney+ series after two seasons due to a post likening the treatment of American conservatives to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Her posts were widely criticized online and spurred a trending #FireGinaCarano hashtag. I have come to an agreement with Disney/Lucasfilm @disney @Lucasfilm which I believe is the best outcome for all parties involved. I hope this brings some healing to the force. I want to extend my deepest most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, @elonmusk a man I‚Äôve never met,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/qiAX7W1vgf ‚Äî Gina Carano üïØ (@ginacarano) August 7, 2025 Advertisement ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to thank you all for your unrelenting support throughout my life and career, you‚Äôve been the heartbeat that has kept my story alive. I hope to make you proud,‚Äù Carano wrote in a statement Thursday. ‚ÄúI am excited to flip the page and move onto the next chapter. My desires remain in the arts, which is where I hope you will join me.‚Äù Carano thanked Elon Musk for helping fund the lawsuit ‚Äúand asking for nothing in return.‚Äù The suit had alleged that the 43-year-old actor was fired because she ‚Äúdared voice her own opinions‚Äù against an ‚Äúonline bully mob who demanded her compliance with their extreme progressive ideology.‚Äù 20 Years OfFreeJournalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
