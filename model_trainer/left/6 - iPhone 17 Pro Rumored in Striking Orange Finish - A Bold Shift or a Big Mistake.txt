AppleLeaks and Spy photos iPhone 17 Pro Rumored in Striking Orange Finish — A Bold Shift or a Big Mistake? Nick Papanikolopoulos August 9, 2025 Apple’s Pro iPhones have built a reputation for being powerful, premium, and—let’s be honest—a little conservative in their color choices. Shades like black, silver, and dark blue have dominated the lineup for years. But a recent leak suggests that the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro could arrive in a bold, attention-grabbing orange. The rumor comes from a video shared by reliable leaker Majin Bu, showing what appears to be a dummy unit of the device in a bright orange finish. It’s a far cry from the muted tones we’ve come to expect from Apple’s flagship Pro models. Bu praised the color as “so good,” but online reactions are split. Some commenters have hailed it as the standout finish of the year, while others have slammed it as “hideous” or “the worst color in iPhone history.” @AnxiousHolly, for example, said “this looks hideous”, while @black0nder said “the worst color in iPhone history”. But @YSL_Laurentttt said “Let that be official and I’m getting the 17 Pro”, and @vernons said “if it really looks like that, it could be the winner in this year’s upgrade.” Adding some color never hurts If true, the orange iPhone 17 Pro would launch alongside more traditional shades—likely black, white, and dark blue. But more importantly, it could signal a shift in Apple’s design philosophy, with the company finally embracing more expressive colors for its top-tier devices. iPhone 17 Pro orange looks so good pic.twitter.com/N9ehzP6ldn — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 7, 2025 This move could appeal to younger buyers and those craving more personality in their premium tech. While we’ve seen standard iPhone models with brighter colors for years, Pro buyers have been using devices with understated tones. The orange finish could be Apple’s way of testing demand for bolder premium designs. We won’t know for sure until September—possibly on the 9th—when Apple will supposedly unveil the iPhone 17 lineup. Until then, the debate rages on: is orange the future of Pro, or just a passing experiment?
