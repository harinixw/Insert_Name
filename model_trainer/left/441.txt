Top Jill Biden Aide Anthony Bernal Takes the Fifth Fueling Cover-Up Allegations Over Joe Biden’s Health
Former first lady Jill Biden’s top aide Anthony Bernal refused to answer questions in the Republican probe into former President Joe Biden’s health. He is the second top Biden official to take the Fifth Amendment protecting him from self-incrimination after former White House physician Kevin O’Connor also took the Fifth when he appeared to testify under a subpoena last week. Bernal is one of multiple Biden officials called in to give their testimony behind closed doors as Republicans on the House Oversight Committee investigate Biden’s mental acuity while in office. They’ve accused members of the Biden administration of a cover-up. “It’s no surprise that Anthony Bernal is pleading the Fifth Amendment to shield himself from criminal liability,“ posted committee Chair James Comer on X. ”During his deposition today, Mr. Bernal pleaded the Fifth when asked if any unelected official or family members executed the duties of the President and if Joe Biden ever instructed him to lie about his health.” Biden has fiercely denied the allegations of a cover-up or that anyone was making decisions for him behind closed doors while he was president. In a statement to the committee obtained by Daily Beast, Bernal’s lawyer Jonathan Su said any suggestion that taking the Fifth is “evidence of wrongdoing would be highly irresponsible and flatly wrong.” Other former staffers called for questioning by House Republicans include his former White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
