MAGA Personality Roasted For Thinking Comparison To 'South Park' Character Is A Compliment Although Charlie Kirk thought some parts of the parody were funny, many people pointed out that the character spoofing him is the "biggest POS on TV." By David Moye Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 7, 2025, 08:31 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADINGERROR LOADING MAGA personality Charlie Kirk may be laughing at the way he was portrayed on Wednesday’s “South Park” episode, but that doesn’t mean he gets the joke — or realizes he was the butt of it. Besides mocking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice President JD Vance, and the government’s ICE raids on migrants, the show also ridiculed Kirk by having Eric Cartman spoof him as a right-wing podcaster who records his shows sitting on a toilet in a locked bathroom, striving to be a “master debater.” Advertisement Kirk reacted to the brutal parody in a manner similar to Vance — by acting like it was some sort of compliment. “Not bad, Cartman,” he posted on X, with a brief clip from the show.

Cartman is the biggest POS on TV. These are some of the things Cartman has done: 1. 🍲 He made a child eat his own parents 2. 🐷 He dressed up as Hitler and… — Ricardo Zambrana (@Zambranitis) August 7, 2025 Advertisement Others also pointed out the Cartman comparison was no compliment. The Cartman character is written to be purposely satirically bad. He's supposed to be an obviously bad human being. If you ever find yourself identifying with that character, you need to immediately check yourself. — The Dread Bunny (@jpvanhoy) August 7, 2025 Your portrayal isn’t a compliment or respect. They are ridiculing you. They have identified you as a cancer. But of course a clown cares not. — ADAM (@AdameMedia) August 7, 2025 Hahahahhahah it’s even funnier when you acknowledge Cartman’s role in South Park — he’s the hilariously fat and stupid sociopathic kid 😂 — Wren (@wrens_dens) August 7, 2025 Advertisement How do you not understand that South Park hates you lmao — Harry Sisson (@harryjsisson) August 7, 2025 Lol you don't see that this made you look like the tiny dicked sad little troll that you are? There is no way to spin this as a compliment — Stefanie Iris Weiss 🔥⚡️🇺🇦 (@EcoSexuality) August 7, 2025 hey did you see this clip from the episode toohttps://t.co/n5m6dORjru — ✨☁️🎀 𝓮𝓶𝓶𝓪 🎀☁️✨ (@emmamurabito) August 7, 2025 Advertisement MAGA’s trying to laugh along with South Park to save face.
