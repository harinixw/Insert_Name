Kristi Noem Trashes ‘South Park’ Depiction But Still Shares Image To Boost ICE
Kristi Noem Trashes ‘South Park’ Depiction But Still Shares Image To Boost ICE The homeland security secretary decided to act like the insulting portrayal on "South Park" was just an inverted compliment. By David Moye Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 8, 2025, 07:14 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADINGERROR LOADING Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wasn’t happy about the way she was portrayed on “South Park” this week, but that didn’t stop her from using an image from the show to boost ICE recruitment on Friday. The show’s latest episode featured Noem killing a variety of dogs and needing lots of Botox to fix a very sagging face. Advertisement On Thursday, Noem griped about the portrayal to right-wing pundit Glenn Beck, saying that making fun of her looks was just “so lazy” and a sign of the show’s inability to criticize her work (although it did that, too). The makers of “South Park” reacted by making Noem’s sagging face caricature the show’s profile image on X. But what a difference a day makes — because on Friday, Noem decided to use a decidedly more flattering image from the show to get people to join Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security used another image from “South Park” in an ICE recruitment post on Tuesday.
