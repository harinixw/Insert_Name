Meanwhile, Trump fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the release of the latest jobs report. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss this and more. “Trump believes that he has the ability and leverage over Netanyahu,” Alexander Ward, a national-security reporter at The Wall Street Journal, said last night. But the reason that “there isn’t as much leverage as the Trump team believes is because Netanyahu has his own politics, too.” Joining Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer to discuss: Leigh Ann Caldwell, the chief Washington correspondent at Puck; Andrea Mitchell, the chief Washington and foreign-affairs correspondent at NBC News; Alexander Ward, a national-security reporter at The Wall Street Journal; and Nancy A. Youssef, a staff writer at The Atlantic. Watch the full episode here. Explore More Topics Benjamin Netanyahu, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Donald Trump, Gaza Strip, Israel, Washington, D.C.
