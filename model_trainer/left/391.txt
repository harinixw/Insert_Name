Reality Star Pardoned by Trump Says Prison Gave Her a ‘Lung Condition’
Julie Chrisley may have received a pardon from the president himself, but it seems her time in prison nevertheless took a toll. “Listen, I have a lung condition from being in prison,” she revealed in the third episode of the “Chrisley Confessions 2.0″ podcast. The 52-year-old is best known for starring in the reality show Chrisley Knows Best alongside her husband, real estate mogul Todd Chrisley, who co-hosts the podcast. The TV show crumbled following Julie and Todd Chrisley’s 2022 convictions on multiple counts of fraud and tax evasion, though Donald Trump pardoned the pair in May 2025. According to Julie, the culprit of her condition is the alleged presence of asbestos and black mold at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, where Chrisley was held for 28 months. The Cleveland Clinic says black mold can worsen asthma symptoms, while the Environmental Protection Agency warns that asbestos exposure is connected to an increased risk of lung disease. While the prison did not address Julie’s condition, the Federal Bureau of Prisons shared a statement with Us Weekly emphasizing its “mission...to operate facilities that are safe, secure, and humane,” and that it takes its responsibility to “protect the individuals entrusted in our custody” seriously. Todd informed listeners of Julie’s upcoming appointment with a pulmonary specialist for additional tests. Read it at US WEEKLY
