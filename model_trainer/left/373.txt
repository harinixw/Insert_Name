Right-wing media personality Alex Stein interrupted an NBC News broadcast to share his feelings–and MAGA loved every moment.
MAGA celebrated conservative media personality and comedian Alex Stein after he interrupted an NBC News streaming show on Monday by shouting, “MSNBC sucks.” Stein, 38, interrupted correspondent Ryan Chandler, barging in front of the camera and shouting “MSNBC sucks,” repeating himself several times before he was led away. Ironically, he was not interrupting MSNBC but NBC News Now. “Sometimes this happens, and we can understand that that can happen, and while we love free speech, we’re going to keep control here,” anchor Kelly O’Donnell, who is NBC News’ White House correspondent, explained. A 2022 event featuring Alex Stein and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes at Penn State was canceled following protests from students. The organization has been designated as a terrorist group in Canada and New Zealand. Leah Millis/Reuters After crossing back to Chandler, Stein could still be seen shouting in the background; while his shouts were largely unintelligible, an additional ”MSNBC sucks” could be heard, forcing O’Donnell to end the segment prematurely. Stein, who hosts Prime Time with Alex Stein for Glenn Beck’s Blaze Media network, then bragged on X about his antics, posting, “MSNBC is the saddest excuse for a ‘news’ network and telling them they suck on their own airwaves feels fantastic.” MSNBC is the saddest excuse for a "news" network and telling them they suck on their own airwaves feels fantastic pic.twitter.com/WvKYusfKxg — Alex Stein #99 (@alexstein99) August 4, 2025 Others in the MAGAverse were quick to praise Stein, including influencers Benny Johnson, Nick Sortor, and the right-wing Libs of TikTok X account. Not all seemed clear that he had not interrupted MSNBC but NBC News Now. The two share ownership as part of NBC, although MSNBC is being spun off as part of a corporate reorganization. Chaya Raichik’s Libs of TikTok celebrated Stein’s interruption while far-right commentator Sortor called Stein a “national treasure.” Prominent MAGA X personality Gunter Eagleman posted, “LMFAO! @alexstein99 just jumped into an MSNBC broadcast and yelled “MSNBC SUCKS!” We ALL agree!” Alex Stein hopped into a live NBC News hit at the Texas Capitol and didn’t disappoint 🤣 On repeat: “MSNBC sucks! MSNBC sucks! MSNBC sucks!” pic.twitter.com/bqwjZ210jO — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) August 5, 2025 Stein was in Austin to appear in front of the Senate Committee on State Affairs, where he spent an extended amount of time making multiple jokes about transgender athletes and transgender people in the military, arguing that he was in favor of the latter because, “Transgenders are some of the meanest people on planet Earth, so they’d make [good soldiers],” before going on to attempt to draw a link between transgender people and mass shootings. Stein also suggested that the military use transgender people dealing with suicidal ideation as suicide bombers. More than 40 percent of transgender adults in the U.S. have attempted suicide, according to a UCLA study.

He made headlines in 2022 when he harassed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, shouting at her, “Look at that booty on AOC! That’s my very big booty Latina!” He was also briefly suspended from Blaze Media after asking President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump her views on sodomy.
