Fans Express Outrage Over Food Network Post Following Anne Burrell's Death Many commenters found the post "tone deaf" and "disrespectful." By Carly Ledbetter Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 7, 2025, 05:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADINGERROR LOADING Fans are expressing outrage after the Food Network posted a photo of chef Anne Burrell to promote her show, just weeks after she died by suicide. The Food Network shared a picture of Burrell alongside her co-host, chef Gabe Bertaccini, earlier this week to promote a new episode of the long-running show, “Worst Cooks in America.” Advertisement “It’s showtime! 🌟” the Instagram post said with a photo of Burrell and Bertaccini both smiling, alongside a carousel of pictures from the episode. “The recruits step up to the spotlight in the first-ever Boot Camp Culinary Pageant! Competing head-to-head, they show off their kitchen skills in hopes of being crowned Mister or Miss Boot Camp 👑 ” the post continued. “Watch a new episode of #WorstCooks TONIGHT at 9|8c!” The chipper tone struck followers as “odd,” as well as the failure to mention Burrell’s death.

Food Network “If you are going to run the show, every caption should have a respectful note about the loss of Anne,” one follower wrote, while another added, “I get that it’s awkward but seriously, big miss step @foodnetwork by not mentioning @chefanneburrell she deserves it.” Another commenter wrote, “This is such an odd caption, in my opinion. At least acknowledge Anne and her legacy in the caption- this is not an ‘everyday’ type of season premiere and Food Network knows that.” Advertisement The Food Network’s social media team was similarly criticized for its initial post when the latest season of the show premiered back in July. This post, which says it was edited, includes a note about Burrell and her death in the caption. “This season of Worst Cooks in America was filmed with Anne Burrell before her untimely passing,” the post says. “We hope fans will enjoy the digital content we shot with her on set and see her doing what she loved – teaching and sharing the importance of food.” A look at the Food Network's post from July 24. Food Network/WB Advertisement The Food Network did release a statement following Burrell’s death, and has a tribute post to the late chef pinned to the top of its Instagram page. “We are deeply saddened to share the news that beloved chef, Anne Burrell, passed away this morning,” the network shared in June. “Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent – teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring,” the statement added. “Our thoughts are with Anne’s family, friends and fans during this time of tremendous loss.” Advertisement Burrell was found dead at her home in New York City on June 17. The New York City medical examiner’s office confirmed to HuffPost in July that the death was ruled a suicide, as Burrell died from “acute intoxication due to the combined effects of diphenhydramine, ethanol, cetirizine, and amphetamine.” She is survived by her husband, Stuart Claxton. 20 Years OfFreeJournalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
