Tim Cook Slammed For 'Disgusting' Gift-Giving Meeting With Trump
Tim Cook Slammed For 'Disgusting' Gift-Giving Meeting With Trump The Apple CEO presented the president with a “unique” piece of glass held by 24-karat gold during a celebratory event Wednesday in the Oval Office. By Marco Margaritoff Trends Reporter Aug 7, 2025, 01:33 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADINGERROR LOADING Apple CEO Tim Cook is being slammed on social media over his “disgusting and embarrassing” meeting with President Donald Trump, whom he presented with a “unique” piece of Apple-produced glass that sits on a base of 24-karat gold. “This bottom was made in the U.S., in California,” said Cook at the unveiling Wednesday. “And this glass comes off the Corning line. It’s engraved for President Trump, it’s a unique unit of one. It was designed by a U.S. Marine Corps corporal, a former one, that works at Apple now.” Advertisement “And the base comes from Utah, and is 24-karat gold,” he continued. Trump announced steep international tariffs earlier this year on all imports to the U.S. and has urged American companies reliant on foreign manufacturing to bring their production stateside. His meeting with Cook was essentially a celebration of Apple’s compliance. Trump also announced a 100% tariff Wednesday on all imported semiconductor chips, but said companies investing in U.S. manufacturing would be exempt. He noted Apple, which increased its commitment to $600 billion over the next four years, had secured such an exemption. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,” Trump told reporters during the Oval Office press conference. Advertisement Apple announced that “every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass” as a result, and while that might appeal to voters determined to revive U.S. manufacturing, others were soured by Cook’s meeting. “This feels like something you do for Kim Jong Un to avoid having your family fed to pigs. I guess that’s where we are now,” wrote one user on X, formerly Twitter, with another person commenting: “Tim Cook shows the world how to kiss ass like a pro.” Tim Cook: It is engraved for President Trump.

Cook has presented the president with gifts before, however. In 2021, he gave Trump a $5,999 MacBook Pro before he left the White House. While presumably a sure-fire way to land in the president’s good graces, Cook’s latest gesture has left social media aghast.
