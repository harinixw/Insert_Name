The video, shared on the administration’s official social media accounts, shows handcuffed individuals being escorted onto a plane while a cheerful voiceover declares, “Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday,” set to singer Jess Glynne’s upbeat song “Hold My Hand.” The caption read: “When ICE books you a one‑way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!” When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. ✈️🎶 Nothing beats it! pic.twitter.com/hlLapr9QsE — The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 29, 2025 The clip uses audio from the original ad to showcase the European budget airlines deals. But the audio has become a popular meme on TikTok and Instagram, typically paired with vacation mishaps or comedic travel fails. But critics say pairing it with footage of deportations trivializes a serious and often traumatic process. Social media users across the political spectrum condemned the post as “tone‑deaf” and “dehumanizing.” Jess Glynne, whose song was featured in the original Jet2 ad, took to her Instagram stories: “This post honestly makes me feel sick. My music is about love, unity and spreading positivity – never about division or hate.” Zoë Lister, the voice actor in the original commercial, also criticized the White House for co‑opting the ad. A spokesperson Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays gave a statement to the English press, distancing the airline from the post and expressing disappointment that its brand was tied to political messaging. “Our branding has become something of a viral phenomenon this summer and we are pleased to see how many people have used it in good humour. This has put a smile on many people’s faces, just like our holidays do. We are of course aware of a post from the White House social media account. This is not endorsed by us in any way, and we are very disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as this.” The controversy comes as the Trump administration escalates its immigration crackdown, with expanded ICE operations and plans for mass deportations. While the White House has not apologized or removed the video, the uproar highlights the risks of repurposing light‑hearted internet culture to promote hardline policy.
