Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10% because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. The ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, angering Trump who said he would end trade talks with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday and Saturday during the first two games of the World Series. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia. “Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.” It was unclear what legal authority Trump would use to impose the additional import taxes. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the 10% hike would come into effect, and whether it would apply to all Canadian goods.

Canada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Spokespersons for Carney and Ford did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Many Canadian products have been hit with a 35% tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50%. Energy products have a lower rate of 10%, while the vast majority of goods are covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement, and are exempt from tariffs. That trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it. Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario’s ad spelling out the case against tariffs. Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority. ___ Associated Press writers Rob Gillies in Toronto and Josh Boak in Tokyo contributed to this report.","category":"","leftBias":0.34069428,"centerBias":0.42246747,"rightBias":0.23683824},{"title":"US-China trade tensions appear to cool before upcoming Trump-Xi meeting","url":"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-asia-malaysia-china-japan-55a147dce68e6d8fa70c2b858249c7ec","sourceName":"Associated Press","publishedAt":"2025-10-25T20:17:36Z","description":"U.S.-China trade tensions appear to have cooled before an upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S.-China trade tensions appeared to cool Sunday before an upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with each side saying a deal was nearing between the world’s two largest economies. Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips. Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide. China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus,” while Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was “a very successful framework.” Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese “want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.” The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Florida.

The progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker. Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats. Trump attends ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year. Thailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn’t restart. “We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,” Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a “historic day,” and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace.” The president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limited on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks. “It’s very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. Trump reengages with a key region of the world Trump attended this summit only once during his first term, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January. This year’s event was a chance for Trump to reengage with nations that have a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people. “The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,” Trump said. He described his counterparts as “spectacular leaders” and said that “everything you touch turns to gold.” Trump’s tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people. The president threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped. A shaky truce has persisted since then. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.” Tariffs are in focus on Trump’s trip Trump met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Kuala Lumpur, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil’s prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country’s former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country. During their meeting, Trump said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he enacted in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro. “I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” he said. While Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The president is angry with Canada because of a television advertisement protesting his trade policies, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would raise tariffs on Canada because of it. One leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during Trump’s first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak in Tokyo and Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok contributed to this report.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit LOS ANGELES (AP) — June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in “Lassie” or up in the stratosphere in “Lost in Space,” has died. She was 100. Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday. “She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,” he said. “It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.” The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star. From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series “Lassie.” From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure “Lost in Space.” Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos. Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed. “I must quote Dan Rather,” she said in a 1994 interview. “I can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me. “I love rock ‘n’ roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding — the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don’t go with my image.” Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: “All This, and Heaven Too,” “Adam Had Four Sons,” “Sergeant York,” “Miss Annie Rooney,” “Forever and a Day” and “Meet Me in St. Louis.” She also made “Son of Lassie,” the 1945 sequel to “Lassie, Come Home,” playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor. New life on television When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actor to play the female lead in “Lassie” on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show’s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.) Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star: “I worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap. “Lassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.” After six years in the rural setting of “Lassie,” Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in “Lost in Space.” After their mission is sabotaged by a fellow passenger, the nefarious Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris), the party bounces from planet to planet, encountering weird creatures and near-disasters that required viewers to tune in the following week to learn of the escape. Throughout the three-year run, Mrs. Robinson offered consolation and a slice of her “space pie.” As with “Lassie,” Lockhart enjoyed working on “Lost in Space”: “It was like going to work at Disneyland every day.” “So smart, quick, and funny — she filled her 100 years with curiosity, laughter, and rock ’n’ roll,” Angela Cartwright, who played her daughter on “Lost in Space” posted on Facebook. “I can only imagine she’s feeling right at home as she steps off this planet and into the stars.” Bill Mumy, who played her son in the film, posted on social media: “A one of a kind, talented, nurturing, adventurous, and non compromising Lady. She did it her way. June will always be one of my very favorite moms.” In 1968, Lockhart joined the cast of “Petticoat Junction” for the rural comedy’s last two seasons, playing Dr. Janet Craig. A little bit of everything Lockhart remained active long after “Lost in Space,” appearing often in episodic television as well as in recurring roles in the daytime soap opera “General Hospital” and nighttime soaps, “Knots Landing” and “The Colbys.” Her film credits included “The Remake” and the animated “Bongee Bear and the Kingdom of Rhythm,” for which she provided the voice for Mindy the Owl. She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, and toured in the plays “Steel Magnolias,” “Bedroom Farce” and “Once More with Feeling.” “Her true passion was journalism,” Gregory said. “She loved going to the White House briefing rooms.” Lockhart liked to tell the story of how her parents met, saying they were hired separately for a touring production sponsored by inventor Thomas A. Edison and decided on marriage during a stop at Lake Louise, Alberta. Their daughter was born June 25, 1925, in New York City. The family moved to Hollywood 10 years later, and Gene Lockhart worked steadily as a character actor, usually in avuncular roles, sometimes as a villain. His wife, Kathleen, often appeared with him. Young June made her stage debut at 8, dancing in a children’s ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House. Her first film appearance was a small role in the 1938 “A Christmas Carol,” playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit and his wife, who were played by her parents. She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay. Throughout her later career, Lockhart was connected in the public mind with “Lassie.” Even though she sometimes mocked the show, she conceded: “How wonderful that in a career there is one role for which you are known.

(AP) — Shootings at a large outdoor Halloween party in southeastern North Carolina early Saturday killed two people — one of them 16 years old — and wounded several others, a sheriff said. Robeson County Sheriff Burnis Wilkins’ office said that 13 people were shot at the party held at a home in a rural area outside of Maxton, which is about 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Raleigh near the South Carolina border. Wilkins said the shootings stemmed from two groups attending the event that attracted more than 300 people, with ages in attendance ranging from pre-teenagers to about 50. “There’s a lot of interviews taking place, but apparently there was a confrontation between a couple of groups of people and then gunfire between those two started,” Wilkins told WBTW-TV. The sheriff’s office later Saturday identified the other fatal shooting victim as 49-year-old Jessie Locklear Jr. of Lumberton. The office said the 11 others shot range in age from 17 to 43. One of the wounded was taken to a medical facility with life-threatening injuries, while several remain hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, a sheriff’s news release said. Others were treated and released.

Wilkins said his office believes multiple people fired shots and multiple weapons were used, the newspaper said. Sheriff’s deputies had been sent about 1:15 a.m. to what was the party’s location on a loud music complaint. But before they arrived, local 911 operators received reports of the shootings, a news release said. “This was yet another senseless act of gun violence that has taken the lives of two individuals and left many others seriously injured,” Wilkins said in the release. “What makes this even more disturbing is the involvement of teenagers, alcohol, and guns at a large house party.” Alcohol law enforcement agencies also are involved in the investigation, his office said. More than 150 people fled the location before law enforcement officers arrived, Wilkins’ office said, while asking that anyone with information about what happened or who were at the scene to contact sheriff’s investigators. Wilkins said law enforcement wasn’t initially aware of the party because the crowd number was below the local threshold to obtain a permit, news outlets reported. ___ This story corrects the age of the adult killed in the shooting as 49, not 47.","category":"","leftBias":0.2718906,"centerBias":0.42573616,"rightBias":0.30237323},{"title":"Trump travels to Asia and a meeting with China\u0027s Xi as the US government shutdown drags on","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-asia-trip-malaysia-japan-south-korea-890b52697f86c15e3e196c521d564449","sourceName":"Associated Press","publishedAt":"2025-10-25T18:15:00Z","description":"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip where he’s expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping to…","imageUrl":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/fd/1fdf0578-b650-534b-8815-86e641f6babb/68fd1964bbed2.image.jpg?crop\u003d1763%2C926%2C0%2C124\u0026resize\u003d1200%2C630\u0026order\u003dcrop%2Cresize","content":"Trump travels to Asia and a meeting with China’s Xi as the US government shutdown drags on 1 of 8 | President Donald Trump embarks on multi-stop Asian tour as tensions between the U.S. and China escalate in the weeks leading up to a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump headed for Asia for the first time this term, a trip where he is expected to work on investment deals and peace efforts before meeting face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to de-escalate a trade war. “I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,” Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. He said he plans to discuss fentanyl trafficking with Xi, as well as China’s lack of soybean purchases from the United States. “I want our farmers to be taken care of. And he wants things also,” Trump said. The Republican president is using the trip to try to advance his diplomatic bona fides after recently brokering a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas. During a refueling stop in Qatar on his long-haul flight to Malaysia, Trump met briefly aboard his plane with the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and the prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Trump said they talked about progress on security arrangements in Gaza. “It’s working very well. It’s all smooth. The U.S. doesn’t have to get much involved,” he said. Trump was set to arrive in Malaysia on Sunday morning on a trip that comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands for health care funds, there’s no sign of a break in the impasse, but Trump seems to be continuing on with business as usual, including his foreign trip.

Trump’s first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia. On Sunday, he scheduled a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn’t stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire. The president credited Ibrahim with working to resolve the conflict. “I told the leader of Malaysia, who is a very good man, I think I owe you a trip,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump on Sunday may also have a significant meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who wants to see the U.S. cut a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports. The U.S. administration has justified the tariffs by citing Brazil’s criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro — a Trump ally. Beyond trade, Lula on Friday also criticized the U.S. campaign of military strikes off the South American coast in the name of fighting drug trafficking. He said he planned to raise concerns with Trump at a meeting on Sunday in Malaysia. The White House has not yet publicly confirmed the meeting is set to take place. After Malaysia, Trump has stops in Japan and South Korea From there, Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he’s expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump’s planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%. The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office. Trump spoke to Takaichi during his flight. While there, Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip. In South Korea, Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China’s Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official. The meeting follows months of volatile moves in a trade war between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy. Trump was infuriated earlier this month after Beijing imposed new export controls on rare earths used in technology and threatened to hike retaliatory tariffs to sky-high levels. Trump told reporters on Friday that he might ask Xi about freeing Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper founder, saying “it’ll be on my list.” The only meeting that could possibly eclipse the Xi summit would be an impromptu reunion with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Speculation has been rife since South Korea’s Unification Minister Chung Dong-young told lawmakers this month it was possible that Trump could again meet with Kim in the Demilitarized Zone, as he did in 2019. But such a meeting is not on the president’s schedule for this trip, according to the U.S. official. Trump suggested on Friday that it was hard to reach the North Korean leader. “They have a lot of nuclear weapons, but not a lot of telephone service,” he said. __ Price reported from Washington.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit PARIS (AP) — It was shortly after the stunning heist of the crown jewels at the Louvre when Paris-based Associated Press photographer Thibault Camus caught in his frame a dapperly dressed young man walking by uniformed French police officers, their car blocking one of the museum gates. Instinctively, he took the shot. It wasn’t a particularly great photo, with someone’s shoulder obscuring part of the foreground, Camus told himself. But it did the job — showing French police sealing off the world’s most-visited museum after the brazen daylight robbery last Sunday. Plus, Camus figured, the guy walking past the officers was unusually well dressed, in a coat, a jacket and tie and wearing a fedora, adding a touch of Paris couture to the scene. And so off went the photo to AP’s worldwide audiences. From there, fertile imaginations sprung into high gear — whipping up an online buzz. Posts on social media declared the well-dressed man to be a French detective — if you will, a more dashing version of the famed Inspector Clouseau from “Pink Panther” movies — even though AP’s photo caption had not identified him.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit For a quarter century, President Vladimir Putin has faced the specter of Russia’s shrinking and aging population. In 1999, a year before he came to power, the number of babies born in Russia plunged to its lowest recorded level. In 2005, Putin said the demographic woes needed to be resolved by maintaining “social and economic stability.” In 2019, he said the problem still “haunted” the country. As recently as Thursday, he told a Kremlin demographic conference that increasing births was “crucial” for Russia. Putin has launched initiatives to encourage people to have more children -- from free school meals for large families to awarding Soviet-style “hero-mother” medals to women with 10 or more children. “Many of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers had seven, eight, and even more children,” Putin said in 2023. “Let’s preserve and revive these wonderful traditions. Having many children and a large family must become the norm.” At first, births in Russia grew with its economic prosperity, from 1.21 million babies born in 1999 to 1.94 million in 2015. But those hard-won gains are crumbling against a backdrop of financial uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, an exodus of young men and opposition to immigration.

Since the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea, it has included the peninsula’s population of about 2 million, as well as births and deaths there, in its data. The population also is significantly older. In 1990, 21.1% was 55 or older, government data said. In 2024, that figure was 30%. Since the 2015 peak, the number of births has fallen annually, and deaths are now outpacing births. There were only 1.22 million live births last year — marginally above the 1999 low. Demographer Alexei Raksha reported the number of babies born in Russia in February 2025 was the lowest monthly figure in over two centuries. Russia is trying new restrictions to halt the backslide and embrace what it calls “traditional family values” with laws banning the promotion of abortion and “child-free ideology” and outlawing all LGBTQ+ activism. Officials believe such values are “a magic wand” for solving demographic problems, said Russian feminist scholar Sasha Talaver. In the government’s view, women might be financially independent, but they should be “willing and very excited to take up this additional work of reproduction in the name of patriotism and Russian strength,” she said. Harsh demographic history In Russia, as in much of the West, shrinking births are usually linked with economic turbulence. Young couples in cramped apartments, unable to buy their own homes or who fear for their jobs, usually have less confidence they can afford raising a child. But Russia is saddled with a harsh demographic history. About 27 million Soviet citizens died in World War II, diminishing the male population dramatically. As the country was beginning to recover, the Soviet Union collapsed, and births tumbled again. The number of Russian women in their 20s and early 30s is small, said Jenny Mathers of the University of Aberystwyth in Wales, leaving authorities “desperate to get as many babies as possible out of this much smaller number of women.” Although Russia has not said how many troops have been killed in Ukraine, Western estimates have put the dead in the hundreds of thousands. When the war began, many young Russians moved abroad — some for ideological reasons like escaping a crackdown on dissent or to avoid military service. “You’ve got a much-diminished pool of potential fathers in a diminished pool of potential mothers,” Mathers said. That is a particular problem for Putin, who has long linked population and national security, she said. Some family-friendly initiatives are popular, like cash certificates for parents that can go toward pensions, education or a subsidized mortgage. Others are controversial, such as one-time payments of about $1,200 for pregnant teenagers in some regions. Officials say these aim to support vulnerable mothers, but critics say they encourage such pregnancies. Still other programs seem mostly symbolic. Since 2022, Russia has created state holidays like Family, Love and Fidelity Day in July, and Pregnant Women’s Day -– celebrated on April 7 and Oct. 7. Last year, Russia’s fertility rate — the average number of children born per woman — was 1.4, state media reported. That’s well below the 2.1 replacement rate for the population, and slightly lower than the U.S. figure of 1.6 released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Discouraging abortion Some regions have laws making it illegal to “encourage abortions,” while national legislation in 2024 banned the promotion of “child-free propaganda.” The wording in such initiatives is often vague, leaving them open to interpretation, but the change was enough to prompt producers of a reality TV hit “16 and Pregnant” to change the show’s name to “Mommy at 16.” For many women, the measures make already sensitive conversations even more fraught. A 29-year-old woman who’s decided not to bear children told The Associated Press she sees a gynecologist at a private Moscow clinic, rather than a state one, to avoid intrusive questions. “Whether I plan to have children, whether I don’t plan to have children — I don’t get asked about that at all,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions. It’s “a completely different story” at state-run clinics, she said. An increasing number of laws limit access to abortion. While the procedure remains legal and widely available, more private clinics no longer offer abortion services. New legislation has also curbed the sale of abortion-inducing pills, a move that also affects some emergency contraceptives. Women are encouraged to go to state clinics, where waits are longer and some sites refuse to do abortions on certain days. By the time patients have completed compulsory counseling and mandatory waiting periods of between 48 hours and a week, they risk surpassing the time frame for a legal abortion. Abortions have steadily decreased under these laws, although experts say the number of procedures already was falling. Still, there hasn’t been a corresponding increase in births, and activists believe restricting abortion will only harm the health of women and children. “The only thing you will get from this is illegal abortions. That means more deaths: more children’s deaths and more women’s deaths,” says Russian journalist and feminist activist Zalina Marshenkulova. She sees the new government limits as repression for repression’s sake. “They exist just to ban, to block any voice of freedom,” she told AP. Curbing immigration Russia could increase its population by allowing more immigrants — something the Kremlin is unlikely to adopt. Russian officials have recently fomented anti-migrant sentiment, tracking their movements, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children’s rights to education. Central Asians who have traditionally traveled to Russia for work are looking elsewhere, hoping to avoid growing discrimination and economic uncertainty. While the war in Ukraine continues, Moscow can promise financial rewards for would-be parents but not the stability needed for gambling on the future. When people lack confidence about their prospects, it’s not a time for having children, Mathers said, adding: “An open-ended major war doesn’t really encourage people to think positively about the future.” The 29-year-old woman who chose not to have children agrees. “The happiest and healthiest child will only be born in a family with healthy, happy parents,” she said.

Trick-or-treaters may find more fruity candy than chocolate among their Halloween handouts this year. That should be fine with younger consumers, who have been gravitating for years toward non-chocolate candies like gummies, freeze-dried treats and other sweets that come in a variety of shapes, colors and flavors. Last year, 52% of the total volume of Halloween candy sold in the U.S. was made of chocolate, according to Dan Sadler, a principal for client insights at the market research company Circana. But in the 12 weeks ending Oct. 5, chocolate accounted for 44% of the Halloween candy sold in the U.S. Prices may be part of it. Global cocoa prices more than quadrupled between January 2023 and January 2025 due to poor harvests in West Africa, where 70% of cocoa is produced. Chocolate candy is lot more expensive as a result. Chocolate Halloween candy in the U.S. cost an average of $8.02 per pound in the 12 weeks ahead of Oct. 5, while non-chocolate candy cost an average of $5.77 per pound, Sadler said. Here’s a look at Halloween candy by the numbers: $7.4 billion The amount Americans spent on Halloween candy in 2024, according to the National Confectioners Association. That was 18% of all candy sales last year. 30 million The number of M\u0026M’s that Mars Inc. makes each day at the facility in Topeka, Kansas, that produces its Halloween candy. $10,710 The price for a metric ton of cocoa in January, which was an all-time high. Cocoa prices have fallen since then, but Sadler said it will take months for consumers to see the impact of those lower prices. 1,254 Miles between Topeka and New York. If you stretched out all the Snickers bars that Mars makes annually in Topeka, you could make that trip seven times. 61% Percentage of U.S. consumers who bought candy for trick-or-treaters last year, according to Hershey. Hershey said 45% of consumers reported buying Halloween candy for themselves. 40.8% Market share for Hershey in Halloween candy last year, making it the top performer. Hershey said its Halloween assortment — which includes Reese’s, Kit Kat and Almond Joy — was the top seller last Halloween. July 5 Date which Mars started rolling Halloween candy out to U.S. stores this year. Mars makes Snickers, M\u0026Ms, Skittles, Starburst and other candies. 4.9% Growth in dollar sales of non-chocolate candy in the U.S. in 2024, according to the National Confectioners Association. Chocolate candy sales, in comparison, grew 0.4%. 3.6 Average number of weeks ahead of Halloween that Americans buy Halloween candy, according to Mars. Generation Z buys it sooner, around 4.5 weeks in advance. 2 years Amount of time Mars takes to plan for a Halloween season.

These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country’s famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time — on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges. As with “ panda diplomacy,” some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.

The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs “similar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,” Maury said. A short history of modern animal ambassadors Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary’s College of California. While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel “Journey to the West.” When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China — in part to due to their own “cuddly cuteness” and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world’s first Communist state. In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them. Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species. Still, what benefits a species may not be beneficial to an individual animal. Transporting animals over long distances and sending their offspring back to China, as the agreements require, may highly stress animals, said Jeff Sebo, an environmental and bioethics researcher at New York University. “Animal health and welfare matters,” he said, “not just for geopolitical or strategic aims.” A baby golden snub-nosed monkey climbs on a branch in the Shennongjia National Park in Shennongjia in central China’s Hubei province on Wednesday, June 18, 2025.

At the Shennongjia National Park in Hubei, conservation efforts since the 1980s have helped increase the region’s population threefold to around 1,600 monkeys today, said Yang Jingyuan, president of the Academy of Sciences at the park. It’s unclear exactly how to evaluate the diplomatic track record of furry ambassadors. Still, in an era of rising global tensions, “I think pandas are a really useful entryway,” said James Carter, a China historian at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. “Pandas open up an opportunity for people to think something positive about China — they’re cute, they don’t do anything bad.” Golden snub-nosed monkeys sit together in the Shennongjia National Park in Shennongjia in central China’s Hubei province on Wednesday, June 18, 2025.

In the capital, Kyiv, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a ballistic missile attack in the early hours of Saturday, Kyiv’s police said. A fire broke out in a non-residential building in one location, while debris from intercepted missiles fell in an open area at another site, damaging windows in nearby buildings, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service wrote on the message app Telegram. “Explosions in the capital. The city is under ballistic attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram during the onslaught.

Vladyslav Haivanenko said, adding that apartment buildings and private homes were damaged in the strikes. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched nine missiles and 62 drones, of which four missiles and 50 drones were intercepted. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 121 Ukrainian drones over Russia overnight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that such attacks intensify Ukraine’s need for Patriot defense systems. “It is precisely because of such attacks that we pay special attention to Patriot systems — to be able to protect our cities from this horror. It is critical that partners who possess relevant capability implement what we have discussed in recent days,” he wrote in English on X. “America, Europe and the G7 countries can help ensure that such attacks no longer threaten lives,” he said. Ukrainians adapt As plumes of smoke from the attack in Kyiv rose in the background, Ukrainians went about their day shopping in a popular nearby farmer’s market unhindered, having become accustomed to frequent Russian air assaults. “We didn’t know the attack was right here, but even when we figured it out we still came. Despite the Russians’ strike, there are still a lot of people here who need to eat. I knew that people would come to shop, \" said Halyna Stetsiura, 54. The fruit and vegetable vendor arrived very early in the morning to prepare her stall, while the attacks were still underway. Serhi Lihus, 53, a beekeeper, said he was driving to the market when he heard the explosions. “It was still dark, approximately 6:30, everything was on fire,” he said. Still he showed up to the market to sell his honey. Svitlana Shyshlovska, 40, a customer, said despite the threat of attacks, “you still need to buy food to have something to eat and such markets are not an everyday occasion.” Push for air defenses Zelenskyy is hoping Ukraine can purchase 25 Patriots from the U.S. to fortify its air defenses, particularly in cities. Zelenskyy on Friday urged the United States to expand its sanctions on Russian oil from two companies to the whole sector, and appealed for long-range missiles to hit back at Russia. Zelenskyy was in London for talks with two dozen European leaders who have pledged military help to shield his country from future Russian aggression if a ceasefire stops the more than three-year war. The meeting hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed to step up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding momentum to recent measures that have included a new round of sanctions from the United States and European countries on Russia’s vital oil and gas export earnings. The talks also addressed ways of helping protect Ukraine’s power grid from Russia’s almost daily drone and missile attacks as winter approaches, enhancing Ukrainian air defenses, and supplying Kyiv with longer-range missiles that can strike deep inside Russia. Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to send Tomahawk missiles, an idea U.S. President Donald Trump has considered. Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s envoy for investment and economic cooperation, said Friday he believes Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine were “quite close to a diplomatic solution” to end the three-year war. Speaking to CNN after arriving in Washington for talks with U.S. officials, Dmitriev said a planned summit in Budapest between Trump and Putin had not been canceled but would likely occur later. Trump said Tuesday his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Malaysia on Saturday, the U.S. president said he would only reschedule the meeting if he was certain of progress. “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal. I’m not going to be wasting my time. I’ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin but this has been very disappointing,” Trump said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made clear in public comments Tuesday that Russia is opposed to an immediate ceasefire. A White House official confirmed Friday that Dmitriev, who announced his visit on X, will meet with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting. ___ Morton reported from London.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, pledged Friday to further embrace his Muslim identity in response to growing attacks by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his surrogates that he characterized as “racist and baseless.” Encircled by faith leaders outside a Bronx mosque, Mamdani spoke in emotional terms about the “indignities” long faced by the city’s Muslim population, choking back tears as he described his aunt’s decision not to ride the subway after the Sept. 11 attacks because she didn’t feel safe being seen in a religious head covering. He recounted how, when he first entered politics, an uncle gently suggested he keep his faith to himself. “These are lessons that so many Muslim New Yorkers have been taught,” Mamdani said. “And over these last few days, these lessons have become the closing messages of Andrew Cuomo, Curtis Sliwa and Eric Adams.” At a news conference later Friday, Cuomo accused Mamdani of “playing the victim” for political purposes and denied that Islamophobia existed on a wide scale in New York. Throughout the race, Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has been criticized by Cuomo and others over his criticism of Israel’s government which he had accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

Then came Zohran Mamdani 6 MIN READ But the tone of those attacks have amped up in recent days, drawing allegations from some Democrats that Cuomo’s campaign is leaning into Islamophobia in the final stretch of the campaign. ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Appearing on a conservative radio station Thursday, Cuomo appeared to laugh along at host Sid Rosenberg’s suggestion that Mamdani would “be cheering” another 9/11 attack. “That’s another problem,” Cuomo replied. A Cuomo social media account posted, then removed, a video depicting Mamdani eating rice with his hands and describing his supporters as criminals. A campaign spokesperson said the video was posted in error. At an event endorsing the former governor, Mayor Eric Adams invoked the possibility of terrorist attacks in New York City, seeming to suggest — without explanation — they would be more likely under a Mamdani administration. “New York can’t be Europe. I don’t know what is wrong with people,” Adams said, standing alongside Cuomo. “You see what’s playing out in other countries because of Islamic extremism.” At a debate earlier this week, Sliwa, the Republican candidate, falsely smeared Mamdani as a supporter of “global jihad.” Asked about Rosenberg’s comments, Cuomo said he “didn’t take the remarks seriously at the time.” “Of course I think it’s an offensive comment. But it did not come out of my mouth,” he added. Messages left with Adams’ and Sliwa’s campaign were not immediately returned. In his speech Friday, Mamdani said he was aiming his remarks not at political opponents but at his fellow Muslim New Yorkers. “The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he said. “And yet for too long we have been told to ask for less than that, and to be satisfied with whatever little we receive.” “No more,” he said. To that end, Mamdani said he would further embrace his Muslim identity, a decision he said he consciously avoided at the start of his campaign. “I thought that if I behaved well enough, or bit my tongue enough in the face of racist, baseless attacks, all while returning back to my central message, it would allow me to be more than just my faith,” Mamdani said. “I was wrong. No amount of redirection is ever enough.” He continued: “I will not change who I am, how I eat, or the faith that I’m proud to call my own. But there is one thing that I will change. I will no longer look for myself in the shadows. I will find myself in the light.” Mamdani, who won the primary in stunning fashion, has faced skepticism from some in the Democratic establishment, particularly over his criticism of Israel. On Friday, Mamdani earned the endorsement of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Cuomo told reporters that Mamdani’s criticism of Israel had made Jewish people afraid to leave their homes. He also rejected Mamdani’s claim that Muslim New Yorkers have been made to feel uncomfortable in their own city. “Don’t tell me New Yorkers are Islamophobic. They’re not,” Cuomo said. “What he is doing is the oldest, dirtiest political trick in the book: divide people,” Cuomo said.

From dawn to dusk, Abdulmumen, 25, has looked over a flock of 400 animals for months in Los Cortijos, a village of 850 people in the plains of Castile-La Mancha, the region in central Spain made famous by the 17th-century classic “Don Quixote.” Los Cortijos is among hundreds of rural villages and towns in the region coping with depopulation, which has made it tough to find shepherds, a job that has existed since biblical times. Few Spaniards are willing to do it anymore. To fill that gap and also find work for recent migrants, a government program is training arrivals like Abdulmumen — many from countries in Africa, but also from Venezuela and Afghanistan — whom local farms depend upon to herd the animals whose milk produces central Spain’s prized sheep’s milk cheese.

Esteban left Los Cortijos himself for eight years, first to study history at a nearby university, and then to Wales, where he worked odd jobs before returning home during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I didn’t see my future here,” said Esteban, 32. “But due to life circumstances, I decided to come back and … being here made me say, ‘Well, maybe there is a future.’” Spain’s interior has experienced decades of rural exodus, starting around 1950, as generations of young people left the countryside in search of work and opportunity in cities. Today, about 81% percent of the country’s residents live in urban areas. In 1950, about 60% did, according to the Bank of Spain. Farmers and other agricultural laborers represent less than 4% of Spain’s working population, even as the country is one of Europe’s leading agricultural producers.

He works alongside his 61-year-old father and Abdulmumen, using drones to monitor the animals and pastures. He also makes cheese that he later sells at markets and to restaurants. Shepherding school in Toledo The new shepherds begin their training in a bare classroom just outside the fortified medieval city of Toledo, where, on a recent morning, nearly two dozen migrants learned about coaxing flocks of sheep, handling them and guiding suction cups onto their teats. They are taught the fundamentals over five days — just enough time to convey the basics to students who often speak only halting Spanish, but are eager to work. After a day of on-site training, and if they are authorized to work in Spain, they can apply to be matched with a farm. Sharifa Issah, a 27-year-old migrant from Ghana, said she wanted to train to work with sheep because she had tended to animals back home. “I’m happy with animals,” Issah said.

Many students are asylum-seekers, like Abdulmumen, who is from the Sudanese region of Darfur. Organizations including the International Red Cross connect migrants with Luna’s program.

At 18, he left Sudan, arriving first in Egypt, where he found work in construction. Over the next four years, he moved between Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt again before finally crossing into Ceuta — the Spanish enclave on Morocco’s northern coast — where he applied for asylum. Eventually, he made his way to mainland Spain. Today, Abdulmumen lives alone in Los Cortijos, where he is one of three Africans, he said. At home, he studies Spanish and watches television. On weekends, he plays soccer with people around his age who visit from a nearby city, but the lack of young people in town is challenging, he said. Abdulmumen’s days begin at five in the morning with Muslim prayer before he heads to the farm, where he stays past sundown. About once every month, he calls his family in Sudan, where a civil war has raged since April 2023, but cell service is spotty in their village. A month can become two, he said. He last saw them seven years ago. “That’s the only difficult part,” he said, a small prayer mat beside him on the floor. He earns about 1,300 euros ($1,510) a month, slightly above Spain’s minimum wage. With that, he said he can send some money home once every couple of months. “After, I look for another job, but not now. I like this job, it’s more calm and the town is, too. I like living here in the town,” he said. Sudanese shepherd Osam Abdulmumen milks goats at farm in Los Cortijos, central Spain, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Pregnancy centers in the U.S. that discourage women from getting abortions have been adding more medical services — and could be poised to expand further. The expansion — ranging from testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections to even providing primary medical care — has been unfolding for years. It gained steam after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, clearing the way for states to ban abortion. The push could get more momentum with Planned Parenthood closing some clinics and considering shuttering others following changes to Medicaid. Planned Parenthood is not just the nation’s largest abortion provider, but also offers cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other reproductive health services. “We ultimately want to replace Planned Parenthood with the services we offer,” said Heather Lawless, founder and director of Reliance Center in Lewiston, Idaho. She said about 40% of patients at the anti-abortion center are there for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, including some who use the nurse practitioner as a primary caregiver. The changes have frustrated abortion-rights groups, who, in addition to opposing the centers’ anti-abortion messaging, say they lack accountability; refuse to provide birth control; and most offer only limited ultrasounds that cannot be used for diagnosing fetal anomalies because the people conducting them don’t have that training. A growing number also offer unproven abortion-pill reversal treatments.

They also don’t have to follow standards required by Medicaid or private insurers, though those offering certain services generally must have medical directors who comply with state licensing requirements. ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. “There are really bedrock questions,” said Jennifer McKenna, a senior adviser for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, a project funded by liberal policy organizations that researches the pregnancy centers, “about whether this industry has the clinical infrastructure to provide the medical services it’s currently advertising.” Post-Roe world opened new opportunities Perhaps best known as “crisis pregnancy centers,” these mostly privately funded and religiously affiliated centers were expanding services such as diaper banks ahead of the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling. As abortion bans kicked in, the centers expanded medical, educational and other programs, said Moira Gaul, a scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of SBA Pro-Life America. “They are prepared to serve their communities for the long-term,” she said in a statement. In Sacramento, California, for instance, Alternatives Pregnancy Center in the last two years has added family practice doctors, a radiologist and a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, along with nurses and medical assistants. Alternatives — an affiliate of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of pregnancy centers in the U.S — is some patients’ only health provider. When The Associated Press asked to interview a patient who had received only non-pregnancy services, the clinic provided Jessica Rose, a 31-year-old woman who took the rare step of detransitioning after spending seven years living as a man, during which she received hormone therapy and a double mastectomy. For the last two years, she’s received all medical care at Alternatives, which has an OB-GYN who specializes in hormone therapy. Few, if any, pregnancy centers advertise that they provide help with detransitioning. Alternatives has treated four similar patients over the past year, though that’s not its main mission, director Heidi Matzke said. “APC provided me a space that aligned with my beliefs as well as seeing me as a woman,” Rose said. She said other clinics “were trying to make me think that detransitioning wasn’t what I wanted to do.” Pregnancy centers expand as health clinics decline As of 2024, more than 2,600 anti-abortion pregnancy centers operated in the U.S., up 87 from 2023, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project led by University of Georgia public health researchers who are concerned about aspects of the centers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 765 clinics offered abortions last year, down more than 40 from 2023. Over the years, pregnancy centers have received a boost in taxpayer funds. Nearly 20 states, largely Republican-led, now funnel millions of public dollars to these organizations. Texas alone sent $70 million to pregnancy centers this fiscal year, while Florida dedicated more than $29 million for its “Pregnancy Support Services Program” This boost in resources is unfolding as Republicans have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds under the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. While federal law already blocked the use of taxpayer funds for most abortions, Medicaid reimbursements for other health services were a big part of Planned Parenthood’s revenue. Planned Parenthood said its affiliates could be forced to close up to 200 clinics. Some already had closed or reorganized. They have cut abortion in Wisconsin and eliminated Medicaid services in Arizona. An independent group of clinics in Maine stopped primary care for the same reason. The uncertainty is compounded by pending Medicaid changes expected to result in more uninsured Americans. Some abortion-rights advocates worry that will mean more health care deserts where the pregnancy centers are the only option for more women. Kaitlyn Joshua, a founder of abortion-rights group Abortion in America, lives in Louisiana, where Planned Parenthood closed its clinics in September. She’s concerned that women seeking health services at pregnancy centers as a result of those closures won’t get what they need. “Those centers should be regulated. They should be providing information which is accurate,” she said, “rather than just getting a sermon that they didn’t ask for.” Thomas Glessner, founder and president of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a network of 1,800 centers, said the centers do have government oversight through their medical directors. “Their criticism,” he said, “comes from a political agenda.” In recent years, five Democratic state attorneys general have issued warnings that the centers, which advertise to people seeking abortions, don’t provide them and don’t refer patients to clinics that do. And the Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a state investigation of an organization that runs centers in New Jersey stifles its free speech. Pregnancy centers don’t offer exactly the same services as Planned Parenthood Choices Medical Services in Joplin, Missouri, where the Planned Parenthood clinic closed last year, moved from focusing solely on discouraging abortion to a broader sexual health mission about 20 years ago when it began offering STI treatment, said its executive director, Karolyn Schrage. The center, funded by donors, works with law enforcement in places where authorities may find pregnant adults, according to Arkansas State Police and Schrage. She estimates that more than two-thirds of its work isn’t related to pregnancy. Hayley Kelly first encountered Choices volunteers in 2019 at a regular weekly dinner they brought to dancers at the strip club where she worked. Over the years, she went to the center for STI testing. Then in 2023, when she was uninsured and struggling with drugs, she wanted to confirm a pregnancy. She anticipated the staff wouldn’t like that she was leaning toward an abortion, but she says they just answered questions. She ended up having that baby and, later, another. “It’s amazing place,” Kelly said. “I tell everybody I know, ‘You can go there.’” The center, like others, does not provide contraceptives — standard offerings at sexual health clinics that experts say are best practices for public health. “Our focus is on sexual risk elimination,” Schrage said, “not just reduction.” GEOFF MULVIHILL Mulvihill covers topics on the agendas of state governments across the country.

Old Reddit posts haunt Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner 08:44 Oct. 25, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT By Eugene Daniels When it came time to recruit candidates for next year’s midterms, some Democrats had a goal of finding political newcomers who don’t talk like Beltway insiders and are ready to fight back against the Trump administration. As the saying goes, be careful what you wish for. U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner of Maine, a gruff veteran turned oysterman, seemed to fit the bill: marrying left-leaning policies with the blunt talk of the blue-collar men Democrats have been hoping to win back. Some in the party fell in love. Others thought that two-term Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who jumped in the race in mid-October, might be a less risky choice. Their point was underscored this month when an avalanche of opposition research on Platner began making headlines. The information was largely drawn from his Reddit account, where he posted under the name “P-Hustle.” The posts had something in there to offend everyone, including Platner referring to himself as a communist, calling cops “bastards,” making insensitive remarks about sexual assault and arguing that Black customers don’t tip. Then came the centerpiece: the revelation that Platner had a tattoo that resembled a symbol associated with Nazis. (He’s since had it covered up and has said that he did not realize the supposed Nazi connection when he got it.) The controversy has forced Democrats to wrestle with thorny questions about where to draw the line. The controversy has forced Democrats to wrestle with thorny questions about where to draw the line on offensive conduct and who gets to set such boundaries. Former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones knows a thing or two about a campaign hitting trouble. When he ran for Senate in 2016, his general election opponent, Roy Moore, was accused of sexual misconduct by several women, one of whom told the Washington Post that she was 14 at the time that a 32-year-old Moore sexually touched her. (Moore denied the accusation.) The accusations helped sink Moore\u0027s campaign. Jones told me that the Democratic Party is at a crossroads and has to figure out the balance. “Things like overt racism, overt misogyny … are bright lines, [but] it’s hard to draw a fine line, especially these days, because frankly I think the needle has moved a little bit to where people are more tolerant of so many things.” He said he would lean toward the party being a bit more understanding than it has been in past election cycles. “We need to be a little bit more forgiving if somebody has truly convinced you that ‘I was in a bad place’ or whatever,” he said. Maine\u0027s Platner is putting Democrats through a political stress test: Semafor 07:56 It wasn’t too long ago that just one or two of those social media posts would have been enough to sink a Democratic primary campaign. But the fact that the party is even wrestling with forgiving Platner is proof of how much has changed. The biggest evolution seems to be tied to how Republicans have operated for years. Many Republicans spoke out against Donald Trump in 2016 after the “Access: Hollywood” tape leaked, but he won anyway. As president, Trump then stood by problematic nominees such as Moore and Herschel Walker. More recently, Vice President JD Vance defended Republican operatives who had compared Black people to monkeys and fantasized about gas chambers in leaked texts. No Democrat I’ve talked with wants to go that far. But they are having a more fulsome conversation about where to draw the line than they would have had in the past. “The Democratic Party, sometimes we want to grow our candidates in the lab and check all the right boxes and not make any mistakes or, you know, do anything f—ed up or be interesting throughout their lives and then win. Donald Trump was a big wake up call for me,” former Obama aide and current Crooked Media host Tommy Vietor told me. Another factor is the age of social media. Any candidate who doesn’t qualify for AARP probably posted something embarrassing or regrettable on a social media network at some point, especially if they weren’t the kind of person who grows up wanting to be president. But while Republicans are mostly doubling down on their remarks or denying having made them, Democrats are looking for a show of contrition. If a candidate’s apology seems sincere, the offense was long ago and it’s out of line with their recent behavior and views, they may get a pass. If small donors keep showing up and voters choose the candidate anyway, there’s not much the party can do about it. At the end of the day, it won’t be up to Beltway insiders anyway. The party can try to force out a primary candidate with a problematic history, but if small donors keep showing up and voters choose the candidate anyway, there’s not much the party can do about it. In Maine, the voters seem nonplussed so far about Platner’s past. In University of New Hampshire polling conducted before and after the various news about Platner broke, 58% of those who responded still chose him, compared to 24% for Mills. The next test for the party will come when the candidate isn’t someone like Platner. Many Black Democrats have said they want to see the same willingness to forgive when the candidate with the troubling remarks isn’t a white man. But that’s a conversation for another day.

Van Hollen on Trump\u0027s Venezuelan boat strikes 11:33 Oct. 25, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT By Hayes Brown, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor Last week saw an escalation of the ongoing U.S. military strikes against supposed drug smugglers in international waters. The string of attacks on unidentified targets, all of whom the Trump administration has labeled “narco-terrorists,” in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean are without parallel in American military history. But the closest comparison, last decade’s campaign of drone strikes against targets in Central Asia and elsewhere against suspected terrorist cell members, serves as an ominous prelude to the current lawless enterprise. Much like Trump’s string of extralegal killings, the signature strike program allowed the military to rain death down on its targets regardless of whether their identity was fully known. President Donald Trump has claimed that the strikes are part of an ongoing war against drug cartels bringing fentanyl into the United States. “Every boat kills 25,000 on average — some people say more,” he claimed in September when addressing the military’s top brass. “You see these boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too.” That language is shared across the administration when defending the attacks, even as they’ve provided no evidence to back up their claims that the boats were even carrying drugs, let alone making their way to the United States. Moreover, as The Washington Post reported last week, the routes that the U.S. has struck most frequently off the coast of Venezuela are not used to traffic fentanyl as Trump claims. Most of the synthetic drug that makes its way to America, causing an estimated 48,000 overdose deaths last year, is produced in Mexico and most often smuggled across the border by American citizens. And even if they were, as the ACLU’s Brett Max Kaufman recently noted, the bombings against these potentially innocent civilians are “extrajudicial killings that are flagrantly illegal under both domestic and international law.” His assessment echoes those of human rights groups and others who similarly protested the Obama-era use of so-called “signature strikes” as part of the Global War on Terror. Much like Trump’s string of extralegal killings, the signature strike program allowed the military to rain death down on its targets regardless of whether their identity was fully known. Drone operators were cleared to fire at people and locations that matched up with “signature” behaviors that marked them as likely members of a terrorist cell. Pentagon sends Navy air carrier strike group to Latin America to combat drug cartels 04:26 President Barack Obama’s foreign policy team spent much of his two terms trying to legally justify the drone war, and signature strikes especially. New systems were developed, reviews launched, guidelines issued in the name of reducing civilian casualties and raising accountability. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) drafted internal memos, finding ways domestic laws allowed the strikes to continue apace. But the underlying nature of the program remained firmly in place, even as the criteria to be added to kill lists remained opaque or vague. When he first took office in 2017, Trump immediately moved to loosen or outright revoke many of the rules constraining the drone program his predecessor installed. The result was a major increase in the number of drone strikes in general and a lack of clarity on how many civilians were killed as a result. President Joe Biden signed a classified policy in 2022, according to The New York Times, “limiting counterterrorism drone strikes outside conventional war zones.” The cavalier sentiment undergirds the disgregard for the law or even accuracy that the bombing campaign is being given within the administration. Since Trump returned to office, no similar official policy shift or similar top-level internal debate has been reported surrounding the use of force against boats far outside any official combat zone. What few military lawyers remain in place at the Pentagon with concerns about this lawlessness have reportedly been ignored or silenced. Charles Young, Trump’s nominee to be the Army’s general counsel, told the Senate earlier this month that the OLC has drawn up a memo to justify the operation, but neither the White House, Justice Department, nor Pentagon have provided any hint at how the office reached its conclusions. Instead, the administration has leaned on claims that the U.S. is acting in “self-defense,” a real international law concept that in no way applies to bombing alleged drug smugglers. The GOP-controlled Congress doesn’t seem particularly interested in investigating those claims. Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told reporters last week that he has no plans to hold hearings on the strikes as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. There is a vote in the Senate lined up to disapprove of the strikes and any military action towards Venezuela, where Trump has claimed many of the boats fired upon originate. Even if the resolution passes, with the House still in perpetual recess during the shutdown, and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., unlikely to bring the matter to a vote, it may be dead in the water. It may be a moot point, as Trump said Thursday that he doesn’t intend to seek any formal approval for these strikes, as he is constitutionally required to if this were really a “war” as he claims. “I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” the president said. “I think we are going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We are going to kill them, you know? They are going to be, like, dead.” The cavalier sentiment undergirds the seeming disregard for the law or even accuracy that the bombing campaign is being given within the administration. There is no care for whose bodies are washing up on the shores of Trinidad, not so long as the president gets to flaunt the might of the United States against an enemy that doesn’t even know it’s being targeted.

His envoys need to focus on ending the mass starvation of Palestinians. Vance in Israel to address fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza 04:30 Oct. 25, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT By Sari Bashi, human rights lawyer and former program director at Human Rights Watch Secretary of State Marco Rubio is the latest Trump envoy visiting Israel in a bid to keep the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan intact despite the actions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government — which include, in Rubio’s words, “threatening the peace deal” by allowing preliminary approval of a bill to annex the West Bank. Following his trip to Israel last week, President Donald Trump has sent several senior officials to Jerusalem, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Vice President JD Vance and, most recently, Rubio. Trump’s peace plan, which is the basis for the Oct. 10 ceasefire, reads more like one of his stream-of-consciousness social media posts than a binding agreement. It’s been almost two weeks since the deal to end the war in Gaza went into effect, with little clarity about its 20 points and an even smaller chance of implementing most of them. One part of the Trump plan, however, is unambiguous — and should never have been up for negotiation in the first place: the commitment to protect civilians, in particular by facilitating humanitarian aid and allowing Palestinians to travel into and out of Gaza. The text of Trump’s peace plan, which is the basis for the Oct. 10 ceasefire, reads more like one of his stream-of-consciousness social media posts than a binding agreement. It recognizes Palestinian statehood aspirations but establishes a neocolonial international board, chaired by Trump, to rule Palestinians in Gaza. It requires Hamas to disarm, even though Trump said it didn\u0027t \"bother him much\" that the group used violence to \"take out a couple of gangs that were very bad\" in Gaza. And its call for an international stabilization force, which Vance and Rubio were supposed to be brokering this week, seems destined to fail because, to start, there’s no clarity about the role of Hamas or any other Palestinian actor; sporadic hostilities continue; and third-party countries don’t want to be seen as occupying Gaza or fighting Hamas on Israel’s behalf. Rubio reiterated the pledge to set up an international force during a visit Friday to a U.S.-led command center in southern Israel but did not provide details. Trump says if Hamas doesn\u0027t disarm, \u0027we will disarm them\u0027 12:30 Other provisions have been partially implemented: Hamas has released the 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 15 others; Israel has released 1,968 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and repatriated the remains of 195 Palestinians; and Israeli troops withdrew to the so-called yellow line, reducing direct Israeli control to about half of Gaza’s territory. But the ceasefire plan also included commitments that should never have been part of political negotiations and have still not been met, like an Israeli promise to allow 600 trucks of desperately needed supplies into Gaza daily and an Israeli agreement to reopen Gaza’s Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt. More aid has entered Gaza since the ceasefire, but nutritious food, medical supplies and shelter materials remain catastrophically scarce, including in Gaza City, where experts declared a famine in August. International humanitarian law requires Israel to facilitate the rapid supply of international aid, as well as to actually pay for and provide essential supplies, as part of its obligations as an occupying power. The Israeli military has instead used starvation as a weapon of war, blocking food, medicine and other necessities from entering Gaza even as it has razed croplands, prohibited fishing and destroyed civilian infrastructure like reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants and hospitals. All of this has created conditions calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, which is part of the legal definition of genocide. The Biden and Trump administrations could have ended these abuses by suspending military aid and issuing targeted sanctions. But they chose not to. The U.S. government bears legal, moral and political responsibility for these crimes, because each year it supplies the Israeli military with billions of dollars of sophisticated weapons that have been used to block food supplies, unlawfully displace more than 90% of Gaza’s population and kill civilians unlawfully. At any moment in the past two years, the Biden and Trump administrations could have ended these abuses by suspending military aid and issuing targeted sanctions. But they chose not to. Thus Israel has continued to weaponize aid, with U.S. backing, contributing to the death of what experts believe to be thousands of people from malnutrition, infectious disease and lack of medical care. That’s in addition to more than 68,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, killed in attacks since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters killed and kidnapped hundreds of civilians in Israel in attacks that constituted crimes against humanity. Trump’s ceasefire plan promised to immediately restore “full aid” to Gaza and finally allow travel. But since the ceasefire began, Israel has twice suspended humanitarian aid, alleging violations by Hamas, and it has repeatedly delayed the opening of the Rafah Crossing. Humanitarian aid, the right to health and the right to freedom of movement are legal obligations that the Israeli government owes Palestinians in Gaza, regardless of what Hamas does or doesn’t do. In the same way, the release of civilian hostages by Palestinian armed groups was an absolute obligation that should never have been negotiated. There are tentative signs that the Trump administration is finally demanding relief for civilians in Gaza. After the Israeli government last Sunday alleged ceasefire violations and announced that it would obstruct humanitarian aid, the U.S. reportedly pressured Israel to quickly reverse course, and aid was restored. The ceasefire plan includes a rare U.S. acknowledgement that Palestinians in Gaza have suffered terribly, and its declaration that Palestinians in Gaza have a right to remain in Gaza supersedes, at least for now, Trump’s earlier call to \"level out\" Gaza and transfer its population to other countries. The U.S. should never have allowed Israeli authorities to starve and forcibly displace civilians in Gaza, nearly half of whom are children. These visits from Rubio, Vance and others should be an opportunity to clarify that whatever else the U.S. ceasefire plan for Gaza means, it can and should mean an end to using human beings as bargaining chips. We shall see if that pans out.

Workers pack boxes at the Orange County Food Bank on May 9, 2025, in Garden Grove, Calif.Paul Bersebach / MediaNews Group via Getty Images Oct. 25, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT By Arielle Hixson and Peggy Helman More than 40 million Americans are days away from losing their monthly food benefits as a result of the government shutdown — and the solution from many Republicans and Democrats is for the other side to cave. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins has already said that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will not be available in November, despite a SNAP contingency fund containing about $5 billion of the roughly $9 billion needed for food benefits next month. Republicans seem intent on putting Democrats to a choice: reopen the government and potentially accept Obamacare premiums spiking, or let people go hungry. For Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., the answer is an easy one: support the Republican continuing resolution. Fetterman noted that he would like to extend the Obamacare tax credits to make health insurance more affordable, as Democrats are demanding in exchange for their support of the GOP funding bill. But Fetterman said he strongly disagrees with using a shutdown to extract those concessions, particularly when one of the potential outcomes is “hungry people.” “That is the Democrats’ Sophie’s choice,” said Fetterman, who has voted with Republicans throughout the shutdown in support of the GOP’s funding bill. 40 million Americans at risk of losing food aid assistance if government shutdown continues 06:03 Other lawmakers don’t seem to be budging, arguing that the prospect of hungry Americans should only motivate the other party to move off its shutdown position. “If the Democrats don’t sign onto this C.R.,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said of the GOP continuing resolution, “then we have a lot of things that are going to run out of money, and SNAP is gonna be one of them.” When MSNBC asked Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., what she suggested families who rely on food benefits do come November, she had a simple answer. “Call your Democrat senator and tell them to open back up the government,” Britt said. And facing the prospect of depleted food benefits, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked Politico what it was going to take “for the Democrats to say, ‘Gee, huh, maybe — maybe people should be able to eat?’” Hawley has offered a temporary solution to the food aid cliff, introducing a bill to reinstate SNAP benefits. “Our kids deserve to eat,” Hawley said in a statement. But the looming problem isn’t doing much to change the shutdown calculus, even for Democrats, though many Democratic lawmakers are looking for alternative solutions to the SNAP funding shortage. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told MSNBC he is hoping his home state, Connecticut, will “fill in the gaps” for his constituents. “We’re very firm, explicit, clear, that we are going to insist on extending the health care tax credit and working at the same time for the SNAP benefits,” Blumenthal said. Similarly, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., told MSNBC that in the coming weeks and months, state funding “is being redirected to try to fill in the gaps here.” But Padilla also admitted that “there is no substitute for the federal government doing its job,” and that “the best way” to address the food aid cliff was for “Republicans to come to the table, work with Democrats to reopen the government and address the spike in health care costs.” \u0027Let-them-eat-cake moment\u0027: Trump gilds the White House as federal workers begin missing paychecks 08:37 Still, even if some states pick up the slack on food benefits during the shutdown, it’s clear some families could face unexpected challenges come November, and Democrats also aren’t budging from their long-held position that the easiest solution to the shutdown is for Republicans to just give in and extend Obamacare subsidies. When Politico asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., if it was worth pushing the shutdown beyond Nov. 1 given the coming food crisis, Warren reportedly shot back: “Worth it to whom? To people who will lose their health care or to people who will lose their food?” “We’re people who want Americans to have health care and food,” Warren said. “The Republicans, evidently, don’t care whether they have either.” Democrats are growing increasingly frustrated by the shutdown and the GOP’s stance, which is that Republicans won’t negotiate on expiring Obamacare subsidies until Democrats vote to reopen the government. When asked if Republicans were putting Democrats in a position of choosing between health care and food aid, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC he was “sick and tired of talking about ways to manage the shutdown when Republicans are refusing to even negotiate.” We’re talking about families that do not have food for their children. We’ve always seen families where parents went without meals to make sure that their kids had meals, but now they’re not even having meals for their kids.” Deb Haynes, executive director of Food for Others Blumenthal also suggested his Republican colleagues are “hurting their own constituents by refusing, utterly and totally refusing, even to come to the table and talk about how we solve this problem.” Asked whether the expiring SNAP benefits changed her calculus on the shutdown, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., told MSNBC that the potential cut to SNAP “further highlights the immoral stance that this administration is taking.” “It also highlights that this has been their plan all along,” Alsobrooks said of Republicans. She repeatedly emphasized the effect of letting Obamacare subsidies expire and again suggested she wouldn’t change her position on the shutdown over depleting SNAP funds. But while each side waits for the other to give in, food banks and families are already feeling the pain — anticipating a growing strain on their pantries as the shutdown continues. Deb Haynes, executive director of Food for Others in Fairfax, Va., told MSNBC that between the government shutdown, cuts at the Agriculture Department and tariffs raising grocery costs, her food bank hasn’t struggled this much since April 2020. “There are layers upon layers of stressors in the emergency food network right now,” Haynes said. “We’re talking about families that do not have food for their children. We’ve always seen families where parents went without meals to make sure that their kids had meals, but now they’re not even having meals for their kids,” she said. Aliymah Lyon, a SNAP recipient in Virginia, uses the benefits to help provide for her 11-year-old son. She said she’s already thinking about how to ration food. “My mom has always taught us how to survive with smaller food, canned goods and all that,” Lyon said. “So yeah, rice, beans and everything you have to use in order to survive.” But for those who depend on these resources, there’s a growing sense of frustration with lawmakers. “I really think it’s a shame what they’re doing on Capitol Hill, you know, because you’re playing with people’s lives,” Alonzo Lockridge, who receives SNAP benefits, said. “Help us.

Idris Elba as the President of the United States in \"A House of Dynamite.\"Netflix Oct. 25, 2025, 6:00 AM EDT By Zeeshan Aleem, MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor Director Kathryn Bigelow has a knack for making movies about America’s power on the global stage that make viewers’ heart race. “Zero Dark Thirty” depicts the manhunt for Osama bin Laden, complete with a lifelike recreation of the raid of Abbottabad. “The Hurt Locker” tells the story of a talented Army sergeant carrying out harrowing missions with a bomb disposal squad in Iraq in 2004. Now, Bigelow has made another such thriller in “A House of Dynamite,” about the U.S. government and military’s attempt to respond to a mysterious nuclear missile fired at the U.S. — in under 20 minutes. But while “Zero Dark Thirty” and “The Hurt Locker” display a fawning awe of imperial power that functions as reactionary pro-War on Terror propaganda, “House of Dynamite” questions the wisdom of the American security state. The movie has some flaws, but it’s a worthy exploration of the alarming folly of American — and global — complacency in a world filled with expanding and increasingly sophisticated nuclear arsenals and severely weakened arms control agreements. That nuclear war doesn’t seem zeitgeisty these days might make it seem like an odd time for “A House of Dynamite” to come out — but that’s exactly its point. Atop our nuclear monarchy today, for example, stands an impulsive, incurious man who has demonstrated no interest in long-term consequences. “A House of Dynamite” derives its suspense from an unfathomably intense ticking clock scenario. After the discovery that an airborne intercontinental ballistic missile — initially assumed to be a routine North Korean nuclear test — turns out to be a missile of unknown origin on a trajectory for Chicago, we watch as defense officials, military personnel, bureaucrats and the president, played by Idris Elba, are abruptly ejected from their daily routines and forced to contemplate not just immediate and unprecedented loss of life in the U.S., but also potentially across the globe. That these operators have to not just absorb the event intellectually but also emotionally, and then scramble to formulate a response in less time than it takes to watch an episode of “Seinfeld,” is absurd — and true to real life. Bigelow’s naturalistic beat-by-beat breakdown of these moments, which includes all kinds of quotidian details of their lives, helps hammer home the absurdity of the predicament. And the film’s conceit of telling the story from the perspectives of different players in the operation illustrates how all of them face extreme constraints in terms of obtaining reliable information for making judgment calls. Rebecca Ferguson as Captain Olivia Walker in \"A House of Dynamite.\"Eros Hoagland / Netflix After the U.S.’ missile defense fails against the incoming missile, the president is given sharply diverging advice on how to respond to what seems to be an unstoppable extinction event for Chicago. A dovish deputy national security adviser counsels the president to wait for the smoke to clear. A hawkish general at U.S. Strategic Command warns the president that a nonresponse could be worse and advises him to consider immediately preemptively striking at any and all adversaries who could’ve sent the missile, proposing an exchange that could possibly set in motion a global nuclear holocaust. And the president — who has the sole authority to make the final call — can’t even get in touch with his wife, who is abroad, for advice. “This is insanity!” cries out the president. “No, sir. This is reality,” replies the hawkish Gen. Anthony Brady of U.S. Strategic Command, played by Tracy Letts. Is “A House of Dynamite” actually realistic? (Mild spoilers ahead.) Some experts contest the plausibility of various points of its premise: Experts on nuclear missiles and national security say the lone nuclear missile scenario is far-fetched, and having a missile of unknown origin is also unlikely given the number of potential satellites that could pick up that information. And NPR reports that while “U.S. forces are capable of launching their missiles ‘on warning’ before an attacker’s missiles arrive … the country’s nuclear doctrine actually emphasizes what’s known as a ‘second strike’ capability. That would allow it to strike back even if it were hit with a nuclear attack much larger than the one in the movie.” In other words, the hawkish general in the film is perhaps more trigger-happy than one would likely be in real life. But none of that should really give us any comfort. Experts say the movie still captures the timing, the decision-making process and the low rate of success of missile defense accurately. And on a deeper level, it serves as a reminder that nuclear deterrence — discouraging a nuclear attack by building one’s own nuclear capabilities — is not necessarily a sufficient safeguard against nuclear exchange that can easily spiral into a global extinction event. The movie raises the possibility that the mysterious missile could be an error induced by artificial intelligence — which experts say will indeed be baked into nuclear systems in the future. The possibility that nuclear weapons fall into the hands of nonstate extremist actors is always possible, and could unravel the traditional logic of mutually assured destruction. And even conventional warfare can always spiral if the belligerents are armed with nuclear weapons — U.S. intelligence officials believe the risk of nuclear exchange has surged dramatically since Russia has invaded Ukraine. Unlikely events are, well, unlikely, but in this realm their consequences are so vast that they cannot be ignored. Kyle Allen as Captain Jon Zimmer in \"A House of Dynamite.\"Eros Hoagland / Netflix And while in the film the U.S. president is hinted at as an Obama-like reasonable leader who could possibly be trusted to behave as prudently as possible, not every president is. Atop our nuclear monarchy today, for example, stands an impulsive, incurious man who has demonstrated no interest in long-term consequences or for the well-being of people he considers to be not on his team. To have him contemplate how to operate in a nuclear emergency is simply unthinkable. Ultimately however being a relatively wise and moral leader is little consolation against the reality that nuclear exchange is controlled by actors with little time to make reasoned, ethical and strategic judgment calls. Part of the point of the film — only underscored by its provocative ending — is to elucidate that this scenario is unwinnable. Don’t hate the players; hate the game. Nuclear arsenals around the world are growing more fearsome, more countries are trying to become nuclear powers, and nuclear disarmament treaties are expiring (the U.S. and Russia only have one remaining — and that expires in 2026). The viewer is likely to leave the movie rightly convinced that there is no humane way to respond to the beginning of a nuclear war, because no humans can or should be trusted with so much power.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Now that’s arresting style. A man who stepped into a photo taken outside the Louvre in Paris during the investigation into a recent brazen crown jewels heist at the famous museum has gone viral. The mystery man, who was dressed in a three-piece suit with a dark-colored jacket and a gold vest topped with a fedora and an umbrella used as a walking stick, had social media buzzing, comparing him to Inspector Clouseau from the \"Pink Panther\" and Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot. Many seemed to believe the dashing man was the chief inspector on the case, while some even speculated his dapper appearance hinted at an elegant criminal who was involved in the heist somehow. HOW LOUVRE BURGLARS OBTAINED TRUCK-MOUNTED FURNITURE LIFT TO MAKE OFF WITH JEWELS WORTH MORE THAN $100M Police officers block access to the Louvre after a robbery Oct. 19 in Paris.

Do the French do everything better.\" But The Associated Press photographer who snapped the curious shot last Sunday claimed he had no reason to believe the man had anything to do with the Louvre investigation, that he was just someone who stepped into the frame.

This photo provided by Interpol and taken from its website shows the jewels stolen from the Louvre. (Interpol via AP) \"He appeared in front of me, I saw him, I took the photo,\" Camus said. \"He passed by and left.\" Parisian authorities also decided to add a little French intrigue to the mystery when asked by the AP if they could identify the man. \"We’d rather keep the mystery alive ;)\" the Paris prosecutor’s office answered.

(SOURCE: KMSP) NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Authorities revealed this week that a man once named a person of interest in the disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit was responsible for the 2006 killing of a Wisconsin woman and may have been responsible for other murders. The Wood County Sheriff’s Office announced that Christopher Revak was behind the death of Deidre Harm, officially closing a case that had gone unsolved for nearly two decades. On Oct. 20, the Wood County Sheriff’s Office shared a letter from District Attorney Jonathan Barnett on Facebook stating that he would have filed charges against Revak if he were still alive. \"I consider this case closed,\" Barnett wrote. \"I believe I had enough to charge and, if Mr. Revak were still alive, win at trial.\" FBI SEARCHES AREA AROUND CAMPGROUND WHERE TRAVIS DECKER\u0027S 3 DAUGHTERS WERE FOUND DEAD Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase spoke to Fox News Digital about his experience investigating the case of Christopher Revak. (Wood County Sheriff\u0027s Department) Harm, a 21-year-old single mother, disappeared after a night out at a downtown Wisconsin Rapids bar June 10, 2006. Her remains were discovered five months later by hunters in a wooded area near Seneca, about 5 miles from downtown, according to WSAW. \"This may provide some closure for many but won’t bring Deidre back,\" the Wood County Sheriff’s Office and Wisconsin Rapids Police said in a joint statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers will always be with Deidre’s family.\" Revak, a Wisconsin native and former EMT, died by suicide in a Missouri jail cell in July 2009, just one day after being charged with second-degree murder in the death of Rene Williams, 36, a mother of three from Mansfield, Missouri. Williams was last seen March 13, 2007, at the Eagle Lodge bar in Ava, Missouri, where she worked. Revak was also at the bar that night, according to FOX 9. In 2024, KCCI Des Moines reported that Iowa and Wisconsin investigators were taking a fresh look at Revak, who had long been suspected of multiple violent crimes before his death. NOTORIOUS ‘SCORECARD KILLER’ LINKED TO DECADES-OLD MURDER NEARLY 45 YEARS LATER Investigators have never found Jodi Huisentruit, who was declared legally dead in 2001, The Associated Press reported. (ABC News Studios) According to a recent documentary, police have examined whether Revak may have been connected to as many as five different homicides over a 14-year span, including the disappearance of Huisentruit. Douglas County Sheriff Chris Degase, who investigated Williams’ case, previously told Fox News Digital that Revak’s confirmed link to Harm’s killing deepened his concerns about the former EMT’s violent history. \"When I started working on the Christopher Revak case, he was my suspect in the murder of Rene Williams,\" Degase said. \"I didn\u0027t think it was his first go-around at it.\" Degase told KY3 that forensic evidence linked Revak to Williams’ disappearance. \"We had his DNA at the scene. We had her DNA inside his truck,\" he said. \"I think the biggest thing was that they weren’t able to find a body. They had no witnesses to come forward to say that she was dead.\" Despite the lack of a body, investigators charged Revak with Williams’ murder based on DNA results. Degase said his curiosity about similar crimes led him to uncover chilling parallels. \"It wasn’t the first time Revak tried to abduct a woman in Ava,\" he said. \"Actually, shortly after his arrest, I Google searched ‘women abducted from bars’ in all the towns that he had lived in. And when I Google searched from Wisconsin Rapids, Deidre Harm came up.\" NEW CRIME SCENE DETAILS EMERGE IN MANHUNT FOR FUGITIVE DAD ACCUSED OF KILLING 3 DAUGHTERS Video That discovery prompted Degase to reach out to Wisconsin investigators, sharing his findings and helping connect the dots between cases. \"I don’t believe in coincidences,\" he said. \"I called the authorities out there and gave them the information I had.\" Degase, who is featured in the documentary discussing the case, said Williams and Huisentruit remain missing, a detail that still haunts him. He didn’t rule out the possibility Revak could have traveled to Iowa. \"Obviously, [Jodi] wasn’t abducted from a bar, but I just thought it was odd,\" Degase said. He added that Revak \"had a dark side.\" \"We’re dealing with what’s possibly a serial killer,\" Degase told KY3. \"During his day, he’s doing his deed to society and helping people and saving people, but there was a dark side to Chris Revak.\" Revak had also been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Huisentruit, a 27-year-old morning anchor for KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa. Huisentruit vanished around 4 a.m. on June 27, 1995, after calling a colleague to say she was on her way to work but never arriving. Police found signs of a struggle outside her apartment, including a pair of high heels and a bent car key near her car. She was declared legally dead in 2001, though her body has never been found. ALLEGED DEVIL\u0027S DEN KILLER INVESTIGATED IN MULTIPLE UNSOLVED MURDERS ACROSS US THAT HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON Jodi Huisentruit was a TV anchor before she disappeared in 1995. (Findjodi.com) At the time, Mason City Police said there was no evidence linking Revak to the case. However, in 2024, investigators from Wisconsin and Iowa reconnected to compare notes about him, according to FindJodi.com. Authorities had also looked into whether Revak’s ex-wife once lived in the same house as one of the last people to see Huisentruit alive but determined she moved out six months before the anchor’s disappearance. Despite three decades of dead ends, then-Mason City Police Chief Jeff Brinkley said in June the department continues to receive and pursue leads year-round.

In 2024, officers searched a property in Winsted, Minnesota, following a tip, though no new evidence was found.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! If safety is at the top of your vacation checklist, one tiny Caribbean island just earned top honors for peace, calm beaches and a world-class food scene. Anguilla, a British overseas territory just north of St. Maarten and east of the Virgin Islands, was named the safest destination in the Caribbean, according to a 2025 ranking from World Population Review, which evaluates crime, policing and political stability based on data from the Global Peace Index. \"Anguilla crime rates are the lowest in the Caribbean, with very few violent or petty crimes to mar its reputation as a tropical oasis,\" the report found. \"Tourists can feel safe and at ease in tranquil Anguilla.\" URGENT ADVISORY FOR EXOTIC DESTINATION WARNS OF \u0027CRIMINAL GANGS\u0027 AND \u0027VIOLENT CRIME\u0027 While the review noted that drug-related offenses are \"moderate,\" it added that such crimes rarely affect visitors. Anguilla, a British territory in the eastern Caribbean, was named the region’s safest destination in new global rankings. (iStock) The U.S. Department of State also lists Anguilla at a Level 1 travel advisory, the lowest possible risk level, advising tourists to simply exercise normal precautions. \"Here, peace isn’t found, it’s felt,\" the Anguilla Tourist Board wrote on social media after the report was released. \"From 33 beaches to the warmth of our community, safety is simply part of island life on Anguilla.\" AMERICA\u0027S WEALTHY ARE QUIETLY BUYING THEIR WAY OUT WITH \u0027GOLDEN\u0027 VISAS Following Anguilla in the World Population Review’s safety ranking were Barbados, St. Barts, Martinique, the Cayman Islands and Aruba. John Rose, chief risk adviser for Altour, a global travel management company, said Anguilla’s ranking stems from several distinct advantages. \"Its isolation and limited access points also reduce cross-border criminal activity, and tourism is managed in a more controlled, boutique environment,\" Rose told Fox News Digital. The designation is a meaningful recognition not only for traveler confidence but also from a tourism economics perspective, he added.

(Slim Aarons/Hulton Archive) Anguilla was also recognized by Travel + Leisure’s 2025 World’s Best Awards as one of the top islands globally — and the highest-ranked in the Caribbean — earning praise for its friendly hospitality, diverse cuisine and luxury resorts. Experts and travel blogs often highlight Anguilla as a remote, exclusive escape free of shopping malls, cruise ships and high-rises where travelers can soak up crystal clear water, white sand beaches and fresh seafood feasts. TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the island \"is noted for its easy-going atmosphere and magnificent beaches and waters.\" Erin Schroeder, an Atlanta-based travel adviser and founder of Major Traveler, told Fox News Digital she agrees that Anguilla stands out as one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. Anguilla is beloved for its white sand beaches and turquoise waters.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES She noted that Anguilla’s exclusive, off-the-beaten-path appeal also makes it a little harder to reach, with only one direct flight option from the United States. \"There’s a high price of entry, as travelers have to fly to St. Maarten and take a boat, which costs about $115 per person each way for a shared ferry,\" she said. Peaceful shores and welcoming locals have helped Anguilla earn the title of the Caribbean’s safest destination. (iStock) Rose offered additional travel tips, like taking a \"layered\" approach to safety by reviewing local advisories, checking with hosts or advisers for up-to-date information and practicing common-sense precautions, like limiting displays of wealth and using registered transportation.

(Tess Crowley/The Deseret News via AP) SHOCK AND RESOLVE: STUDENTS REFLECT ON CHARLIE KIRK’S DEATH, FUTURE OF CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT In the wake of Kirk’s death, more students flocked to TPUSA chapters, Rasmussen reported. \"It\u0027s just been growing and growing,\" Rasmussen told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, we\u0027re seeing hundreds of thousands of students wanting to get involved, thousands of chapters starting at the high school and college level. \"So, you know, it\u0027s something that you can\u0027t really explain other than its courage and its faith and it\u0027s time for students to stand up. And they are doing such an amazing job at having that courage, especially on their college campuses.\" Rasmussen presides over the University of Texas at Tyler, where a new chapter was approved by the university earlier this month. \"It was pretty quiet for a while, but after Charlie passed, we gained almost 100 members. So, it was really cool,\" Reece Cooper, the president of the TPUSA chapter at UT-Tyler told Fox News Digital. The chapter started in January but was not officially recognized by the university until this month. Cooper said the group struggled to find a faculty advisor to sponsor the organization due to the overt political implications of TPUSA being associated with conservative politics. Jonathan Roncancio, the vice president of the chapter, said a majority of the faculty are more left-leaning and that the group did not try hard enough to secure sponsorship from an advisor. CONSERVATIVES FROM PASTORS TO SENATORS WISH CHARLIE KIRK A POSTHUMOUS HAPPY BIRTHDAY UT-Tyler officials told Fox News Digital the chapter applied for registration Sept. 19, and the university worked with the students to facilitate the process. The chapter was approved Oct. 9. Reece Cooper launched a Turning Point USA chapter in January. (Fox News Digital) The chapter eventually found an advisor and was approved after Kirk\u0027s death, which dominated headlines and launched TPUSA into prominence. Roncancio added that they noticed the growth in a GroupMe chat that involved the members. \"We had a lot of people join GroupMe. It went from around 10 people to 120 people overnight, and that was obviously due to the interest in Turning Point. People were seeing it on the news and wanted to learn more about it. And so we\u0027ve had more people come to meetings and come up to us wondering what we\u0027re doing on campus and just what\u0027s happening,\" Roncancio told Fox News Digital. Kirk built a following over the past five years touring the country to debate college students on culture war issues such as gender ideology, racial divisions and the merits of Christian and American values in general.

Ever since his death, TPUSA, an organization founded by Kirk, has received overwhelming support. \"It has been unprecedented,\" Paige Rasmussen told Fox News Digital of the growth. (Fox News Digital) Rasmussen projects further growth because a revival is sweeping the country, inspiring young people to stand up for what they believe in. \"I don\u0027t see it slowing down because I don\u0027t think this is a situation where people are just seeing it online and want to join something that\u0027s popular,\" she said. \"I think this is a revival, and this is where students and just people in general, whether they\u0027re out of school, are feeling this conviction in their souls that it\u0027s time to stand up and be courageous about their values and their beliefs.

Franklin Graham’s Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse launched its inaugural 767 cargo aircraft Saturday, carrying 290,000 packets of vitamin-fortified food, thousands of blankets and solar lights for women and children in Gaza. It was the humanitarian ministry\u0027s latest aid mission to the war-torn region. In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, Graham said the relief effort comes amid continuing instability. \"Gaza is a very volatile place — it is still dangerous. There are more than 2 million people there who need help,\" Graham said. \"What Hamas did was horrendous. It was a massacre. Not only did they take 251 innocent civilians hostage from Israel on October 7, they have also held the entire population of Gaza hostage for 18 years. Hamas has got to go.\" He added the plane’s mission was driven by a desire to show compassion in a time of crisis.

Before takeoff, Graham joined staff and flight crew on the tarmac, bowing in prayer beside the towering white jet that marks a new chapter in the relief group’s aviation fleet. Edward Graham, Samaritan’s Purse COO and Franklin Graham’s youngest son, called Gaza \"one of the most challenging places to work in the world\" and thanked staff for serving despite danger.

Samaritan’s Purse began working in the region immediately after the fighting erupted, sending doctors, nurses and emergency aid. Since then, the organization says it has delivered more than 223 tons of food and distributed over 1 million rations to civilians, while medical teams have treated more than 1,700 patients.

The cargo included not only food but 12,000 solar-powered lanterns to provide light in communities where power has been cut and 12,000 blankets for families who lost homes or belongings. The effort reflects a long-standing strategy by the North Carolina-based relief group to use its fleet of planes to deliver supplies to hard-hit areas around the world. In recent years, Samaritan’s Purse has deployed mobile field hospitals to Ukraine, distributed emergency shelter kits in Sudan and helped earthquake survivors in Haiti. The addition, the wide-body 767 gives the ministry greater reach, allowing it to deliver larger relief shipments on fewer flights. A Gazan woman carries a Samaritan’s Purse relief package during a distribution in the region. (Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) Franklin Graham said that kind of investment was necessary given the scope of human suffering seen in Gaza and Israel. \"This is about showing God’s love to people who are hurting,\" he said. \"It’s about letting them know they are not forgotten.\" The organization has also worked in Israel, where communities remain shaken from Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack and the months of war that followed. Samaritan’s Purse has pledged 42 ambulances, 28 of them armored, to Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, and is supporting 11 major construction projects, including ambulance response stations and community centers equipped with bomb shelters. Former Arkansas Gov. and Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee praised the effort Saturday, writing on X that Samaritan’s Purse is \"the most efficient and effective disaster response organization on the planet.\" The 767 is expected to deliver the food and supplies on the ground in Gaza in the coming days.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were arrested Thursday morning as part of FBI probes into alleged illegal gambling with ties to La Cosa Nostra crime families. The allegations come despite both Billups and Rozier having made over $100 million each in career earnings, while Jones has made around $20 million. With that much money made, it is fair to wonder how the NBA figures allegedly got wrapped up in the scandal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were arrested Thursday. (Jaime Valdez/Imagn Images; Melissa Tamez/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images; Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) \"How could they possibly get into a situation where they would do this? Their lifetime income was somewhere in the vicinity of $150 million. For most people, you couldn\u0027t spend $150 million in your lifetime,\" Notre Dame finance professor Richard Sheehan said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. Billups is accused of making $50,000 playing in at least one poker game, while Rozier allegedly counted up \"tens of thousands\" of dollars after his friend’s bets after Rozier’s early exit from a game. Sheehan said the net worth for Billups and Rozier that he has seen, which were much lower than their career earnings, did not add up. \"The numbers that I had seen in terms of their net worth, though, were in the vicinity of $35 and $40 million. Still, not bad at all, but I look at the $150 million in income, subtract off taxes, subtract off expenses, whatever. And just as a finance professor, I look at that and say, ‘Their wealth should be double $35 or $40 million.’ Easy, should be double that. And it\u0027s not,\" Sheehan said. Sheehan blamed the possibility of \"posses\" that hang on to athletes, resulting in the athletes giving them money. \"Many people in athletes’ orbs would basically view them as walking ATMs,\" Sheehan said.

(John Rudoff/Reuters) 7 NBA GAMES DOJ SAYS WERE AFFECTED BY HIGH-STAKES WAGERS AFTER INSIDE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED TO GAMBLERS He also speculated about the possibility of bad financial decisions from advisors and attorneys for the large discrepancy between earnings and net worth. \"The other possibility is simply that, that they\u0027ve had dealings with unsavory characters like the mafia, that they may not have known about at the time and that\u0027s led them into compromising positions where they feel that they need to do something,\" Sheehan said, effectively reiterating the allegations of the poker scheme. There is one final possibility, though: Plain stupidity and greed. \"\u0027I\u0027ve got $40 million in the bank. But, you know, if I had $41 million, I\u0027d feel a little better.’ If you can do that honestly, then that\u0027s one story. If you need to cut corners, then it\u0027s just really stupid because your future income, in terms of sports, your future income goes to zero, and you may end up spending a fair amount of time in a jail cell,\" Sheehan said. Billups, Rozier and Jones, the latter of whom is a defendant in both cases, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

A local election candidate is making waves for a bizarre protest at a township meeting this week when he dressed up in martial arts gear and unleashed a series of flying kicks and punched through several of his own protest signs. The man, identified in previous theatrical stunts as Will Thilly, is running as an independent for the Cranford Township Committee in New Jersey and has been railing against the mayor on taxes, development policy and civic unity.

He then broke out singing \"Eye of the Tiger\" and asked the bemused crowd to join in. That’s when two helpers on either side of the floor unfurled a sign that said \"Unfair Taxes,\" and Thilly proceeded to kung fu kick through it. One man in the crowd can be seen laughing, and another man held his head in his hands, while a despondent elderly couple got up and left. But Thilly and his crew weren’t finished here. His pals unfurl three other signs that said, \"Closing Our Pools,\" \"Overdevelopment\" and \"Divisiveness,\" with Thilly kung fu kicking through each of them. The two men then unfurl another sign that says \"Let Love Rule,\" which was also adorned with hearts. \"Mr. Thilly, please address your comments to the township committee,\" Mayor Terrence Curran can be heard saying. Unfazed, Thilly then says, \"This is love.\" He walked toward it and the two men embrace him, wrapping him in the sign.

(CranfordTV35) BLUE STATE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEES TRADE BARBS OVER CRUCIAL ISSUE WEEKS AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY Moments later, Thilly took the microphone and aired his grievances to the mayor, accusing him and the township committee of mishandling a controversial 30-year PILOT tax-exemption deal for a 250-unit apartment complex. \"You also voted for the 30-year tax exemption and PILOT at 750 Walnut on Oct. 8 last year. Then, this July, you said you never voted for that deal, that I was lying,\" Thilly said. \"The fact that you, our mayor, cannot remember that you voted for the single largest financial deal and loss in our town history is grounds for that agreement’s annulment. … This is the real reason our taxes are going up so much.\" He alleged that the agreement costs the town millions in lost revenue and contributes to rising property taxes, claiming officials have \"censored\" meetings and canceled a candidates’ debate \"for the first time in history.\" Fox News Digital requested comment from Curran but did not immediately receive a response. Thilly isn’t new to theatrics. Last month, a video of the independent candidate breakdancing at another meeting went viral, drawing more than 1.6 million views, according to CBS News New York. Independent candidate Will Thilly gestures toward a banner that says \"Let Love Rule\" during a Cranford Township Committee meeting in Cranford, N.J., Oct. 21, 2025.

At last weekend’s \"No Kings\" protest in Washington, D.C., inflatable chickens bobbed above a crowd that, according to demographic research, was made up mostly of educated White women in their 40s. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert said the \"No Kings\" protests were a snapshot of an era when emotional catharsis and civic activism have begun to blur. \"What we’re seeing is a kind of group therapy playing out in the streets,\" he told Fox News Digital.

(Clifford Oto/The Stockton Record/USA Today Network via Imagn Images) ‘NO KINGS’ ORGANIZER DISCOURAGES VIOLENCE FOLLOWING COAST-TO-COAST ARRESTS The protest, which drew thousands to the nation’s capital and similar rallies across the country, was aimed at denouncing what participants described as President Donald Trump’s \"kingship\" and blatant authoritarianism. According to researchers at American University who track protest movements, and whose findings were first reported by Axios, the typical D.C. attendee was an educated White woman in her 40s who learned about the demonstration through friends or social media. \"The \u0027No Kings\u0027 movement allows people to feel belonging and community,\" Alpert said. \"Sharing grievances with like-minded people feels good, but it doesn’t necessarily change anything.\" Dr. Jeanine Standard of Canton sports an inflatable chicken suit as she joins hundreds of other protesters for a \"No Kings\" rally Oct. 18, 2025, along War Memorial Drive near Peoria Stadium.

They’re surrounded by others who validate how they feel, and that validation can be addictive,\" he said. \"Some protesters are equating the ‘No Kings’ movement with the Civil Rights Movement. In their minds, there’s an equivalency, but there really isn’t. They want to be part of something historically meaningful, and that longing can distort perspective.\" That fleeting catharsis, Alpert added, can also mask something darker. \"A lot of times people are unhappy in their own lives,\" he said. \"They may have anxiety or anger, and they project that onto others.

Lockhart was born in New York City on June 25, 1925. She made her stage debut at just 8 years old in the 1933 production of \"Peter Ibbetson\" at the Metropolitan Opera House. By 13, she had already appeared on the silver screen, joining her parents, Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, in MGM’s 1938 adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol.\" ‘I DREAM OF JEANNIE’ STAR BARBARA EDEN FEELS VERY LONELY AFTER DEATH OF PAL LONI ANDERSON Iconic television actress June Lockhart has died at 100. (Getty Images) She quickly shared scenes with Hollywood legends, appearing in \"All This and Heaven Too\" with Bette Davis and Charles Boyer and, in 1941, playing Rosie, the sister of Gary Cooper’s character in \"Sergeant York,\" directed by Howard Hawks. By 19, Lockhart was under contract with MGM, earning acclaim as Lucille Ballard in \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1947, Lockhart made her Broadway debut in \"For Love or Money,\" earning a Tony Award — then called the Antoinette Perry Award — for \"best newcomer.\" She made history as the first-ever recipient of the honor. At the time, The American Theatre Wing presented men with lighters and women with small gold medallions. In the 1950s, she won hearts as the gentle, soft-voiced mom in \"Lassie.\" (Getty Images) Lockhart’s own medallion — the first Tony ever presented — was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008, where it remains part of the museum’s permanent entertainment archives. Lockhart’s warmth and grace translated perfectly to television, where she became one of America’s most beloved matriarchs. In the 1950s, she won hearts as the gentle, soft-voiced mom in \"Lassie,\" often working from scripts written by blacklisted writers during the Red Scare. In the 1960s, she boldly went from the family farm to the stars, portraying Maureen Robinson, the steadfast \"space mom\" in \"Lost in Space.\" LONI ANDERSON\u0027S DEATH THRUSTS TURBULENT BURT REYNOLDS ROMANCE BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT \"The premise of the series [intrigued me],\" Lockhart told Fox News Digital in September 2024 of her involvement in \"Lost in Space.\" \"It was a view of family dynamics of a marooned group of scientists and two children and how they survived,\" she shared. \"It was ‘Space Family Robinson,\u0027 a play on ‘Swiss Family Robinson.\u0027 … Each of my costars was a wonderful professional. It was a very happy set with lots of laughs and genuine affection between us.\" June Lockhart, who portrays Ruth Martin in the CBS series \"Lassie,\" in 1964. (CBS via Getty Images) Lockhart also told Fox News Digital it was \"great\" that many still recognized her as their favorite TV mom. Despite having a secret rebellious side on set, she’s always been proud of her squeaky-clean image. She was never tempted to take on a sultry role in Hollywood, nor did she feel pressured over the years to look a certain way. \"I was not offered those parts,\" she said. \"[And] I always eat carefully. … In that silver spacesuit, you had better be in shape.\" Later, she joined \"Petticoat Junction\" as Dr. Janet Craig and even lent her voice to Nickelodeon’s cult favorite \"Ren \u0026 Stimpy,\" showing her range and humor spanned generations. While Lockhart shined on screen, her passion stretched far beyond Hollywood. With two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — and five total for the Lockhart family — she also became a beloved figure in the space community.

Gavin Newsom’s rebuke of the Justice Department’s move to monitor the November election in his state is getting strong pushback, including from a DOJ official who noted the move is not out of the ordinary. \"Donald Trump\u0027s puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month\u0027s election,\" Newsom posted on Friday in response to news the DOJ plans to send federal election watchers to California and New Jersey for their closely watched elections next month. \"Sending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.

During the 2024 election, multiple Republican-led states pushed back on the Biden administration\u0027s efforts to send federal resources to monitor elections, arguing the state measures in place were satisfactory. Election monitors are lawyers who work for the Justice Department, including in the civil rights division and U.S. attorney’s offices across the country. They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents. For decades, the Justice Department’s civil rights division has sent attorneys and staff members to monitor polling places across the country in both federal and non-federal elections. The monitors are tasked with ensuring compliance with federal voting rights laws. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division enforces a number of statutes protecting the right to vote. That includes the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes. And it includes the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.

She also branded the president a \"tyrant.\" \"I am not done,\" she told the United Kingdom outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.\" CNN PANEL SHREDS HARRIS\u0027 COLBERT INTERVIEW FOR HER LACK OF SOLUTIONS AFTER \u0027SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE IT OUT\u0027 Former Vice President Kamala Harris discusses her new memoir \"107 Days\" at the Southbank Centre’s London Literature Festival 2025 in London Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. (James Manning/PA Images via Getty Images) Harris lost the electoral college to Trump 312-226 and went down by 2.3 million votes in the popular vote. She entered the race as the Democratic primary nominee after President Joe Biden withdrew from the election after a disastrous debate performance. Since the defeat, Harris kept a low enough profile until the publication last month of her book, \"107 Days,\" detailing her short, failed presidential campaign. In the book, she argues she had too little time to define her message or distance herself from Biden’s record. She also cited Democrat infighting and a lack of donor confidence. In her BBC interview, Harris left the door open to another White House run, saying her grandnieces would \"in their lifetime, for sure\" see a female president. When asked if that person could be her, she replied, \"possibly,\" signaling she’s considering another bid. Harris said she hasn’t made a decision but still sees herself as having a political future. There is no clear frontrunner to lead the Democrats into the 2028 election, and a potential crowded list of nominees includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom; former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt;, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, among others. Harris said she was undeterred by unfavorable polls. \"If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldn\u0027t be sitting here,\" she said. The full interview will air on Sunday, but the BBC released excerpts Saturday. Harris said her concerns that Trump would act like an authoritarian have come true.

(Reuters/Mike Segar) \"He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice, and he has done exactly that,\" Harris told the BBC. She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk. Kimmel’s show was suspended by ABC after Trump-appointed FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened broadcasters, and the move was celebrated by Trump. Kimmel appeared to falsely suggest the alleged assassin was a MAGA supporter and was brought back on air the following week. \"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists. … His skin is so thin he couldn\u0027t endure criticism from a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process,\" Harris said. Harris labeled Trump a \"tyrant,\" accusing business leaders and institutions of cozying up to the president and bowing to his demands.

The American people don’t care about her absurd lies,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Or maybe she did take the hint, and that’s why she’s continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\" Michael Dorgan is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

Among the few lawmakers breaking ranks was Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa, who voted with Republicans to reopen the government. Now, he’s urging his colleagues to do the same. \"It’s an easy, easy choice to pick my country over the party, especially in circumstances like this,\" Fetterman said on \"Saturday in America.\" On Thursday, the Senate failed in a 54-46 vote to advance a Republican bill to pay certain federal workers during the shutdown, falling short of the 60 votes needed to pass the measure. Only three Democrats, including Fetterman, voted with Republicans. GOVERNMENT LIMPS DEEPER INTO SHUTDOWN CRISIS WITH NO DEAL IN SIGHT Sen.

They argue that failing to act before open enrollment in November could drive up premiums for millions of Americans.

As it entered its fourth week, many federal employees missed their first full paycheck.

He nitpicked over small things, punishing her with days of silence whenever she dared to act independently. To avoid his quiet fury, Muhammad learned to stay silent.

I can’t focus on what I need to do and worry about them. I’m placing them back in Your hands so I can prepare myself to stand before a judge to prove I can care for them.’ At the end of that prayer, I cried for two hours. Then I felt a presence — like someone covering me with a blanket up to my neck. I stopped crying.\" \"I didn’t cry much after that,\" she continued. \"That’s when I began taking paralegal courses to learn how to get my children back.

They would think it’s a group of people. It would only be me.\" When she tried to ask why, he quickly changed the subject.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Kim Kardashian is opening up about being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. The Skims founder, 45, announced in a preview clip of Season 7 of Hulu’s \"The Kardashians\" that her doctors discovered the condition during an MRI scan, telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" The cause has not been identified, but Kardashian’s doctors considered that it might be from stress. MEN\u0027S BRAINS SHRINK FASTER THAN WOMEN\u0027S; RESEARCHERS EXPLORE ALZHEIMER\u0027S CONNECTION What is an aneurysm? A brain aneurysm is the ballooning of a blood vessel in the brain, which can leak or rupture, leading to bleeding, according to Mayo Clinic. Dr. Adam Arthur, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Tennessee, described an aneurysm as a weakness on the wall of an artery, like a little water balloon that forms off a hose. Kim Kardashian poses during a photocall for the premiere of \"All\u0027s Fair\" TV series in Paris on Oct. 21, 2025. The reality TV star recently revealed that she had been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. (Bertrand GuayAFP via Getty Images; iStock) This is known as a hemorrhagic stroke, which can be life-altering and even fatal. Most aneurysms are small and not serious if they don’t rupture. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Arthur — who is also chief medical officer of Medtronic Neurovascular, a California company that produces medical devices that help treat aneurysms — noted that brain aneurysms are much more common in women. KIM KARDASHIAN DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN ANEURYSM THAT DOCTORS ATTRIBUTE TO STRESS FOLLOWING KANYE WEST DIVORCE This most likely has to do with genetics, although \"there\u0027s so much about the brain and about genetics that we don\u0027t understand,\" Arthur said. Aneurysms are present in up to one in every 50 people, according to the expert, and many don’t require treatment or cause a problem. Up to one in 50 people have a brain aneurysm, which is the ballooning of an artery in the brain. (iStock) When they do become problematic, aneurysms can cause a sudden stroke, where a patient may experience the \"worst headache of their life.\" Arthur described this as a \"very abnormal headache, often behind the eye.\" \"That\u0027s a very, very dangerous situation,\" he said. \"I believe that with Ms. Kardashian, it may be that they found it before it caused a stroke, and obviously that\u0027s a blessing.\" What causes an aneurysm? While aneurysms form on the weak spots of arteries that are knit together before birth, some factors can make the event more common. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This includes alcohol binge-drinking, nicotine exposure, certain genetic conditions, and the use of drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Drugs and nicotine are known to be \"very bad\" for aneurysm growth and rupture, since they tamper with blood vessel health, Arthur detailed. A severe headache may occur if a brain aneurysm becomes problematic. (iStock) The expert added that chronic stress has also been linked to brain aneurysms, noting that an overall focus on sleep, diet and exercise can help reduce the risk. Knowing the family history for aneurysms is important, Arthur added, as it’s recommended to get a screening exam, or MRI, if two close relatives have had them. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Treating the condition Although some aneurysms can be suddenly fatal when they lead to a stroke, people experiencing symptoms — typically an intense headache — should see a doctor for treatment options, according to Arthur. If an aneurysm is found before it bleeds, minimally invasive surgery could be performed to avoid a stroke. Open surgery may also be an option, where a surgeon can pinch the aneurysm shut through an incision along the hairline. TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ Smaller aneurysms in older patients can typically be monitored by a physician to ensure that they’re not growing or causing a larger issue, the doctor said. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the U.S., which \"disables way more people than it outright kills,\" a doctor said. (iStock) \"We do have ways of fixing aneurysms now that are pretty remarkable,\" Arthur told Fox News Digital. \"What we can do is put a metal mesh over the opening of the aneurysm or fill the aneurysm with a device and then let nature take its course — and so that blood then forms a clot and scars.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the U.S., adding that it \"disables way more people than it outright kills,\" according to Arthur.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! As the fragile ceasefire in Gaza holds, a new idea to divide the Strip into two areas is gaining traction. On one side would be life under Hamas’s grip. On the other, a vision of what life would be like without the terror group. With Arab states signaling they will not fund reconstruction as long as the terror group remains in power, U.S. and Israeli officials are weighing a new approach of rebuilding in parts of Gaza still under Israeli control behind what Israeli officials call the \"yellow line.\" The hope, experts explain, is to create a living example of peace and recovery that could inspire change inside the areas still ruled by Hamas. The areas currently under Israeli control behind the so-called \"yellow line\" make up roughly 58% of the Gaza Strip, including all of Rafah in the south, large parts of Khan Younis and northern neighborhoods such as Beit Lahia and Shujaiyya. Hamas controls the remaining territory, including densely populated Gaza City. Despite the IDF presence, Hamas operatives remain active near the front lines. VANCE WARNS HAMAS AS GAZA PEACE PLAN\u0027S CIVILIAN MILITARY COOPERATION CENTER OPENS The IDF announced that, as part of the ceasefire agreement and in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground. (IDF) John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, described the plan to divide Gaza into two distinct zones — one under Israeli control and the other under Hamas — allowing rebuilding only on the Israeli side both a \"practical and psychological test, a way to show Gazans what life could look like without Hamas.\" Spencer used the term \"Disneyland strategy\" to describe the concept, which he said was drawn from U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Iraq. \"You take any piece of the problem — here we’re talking about terrain — and you clear out all the bad: Hamas, tunnels, weapons, everything,\" he said. \"Then you let civilians in, and you build something new — markets, buildings, schools, electricity. We called it Disneyland because we wanted it to look like hope — like the future.\" He said the idea follows the \"clear, hold, build\" model used in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops secured neighborhoods one by one. \"In Ramadi, we did it neighborhood by neighborhood until we covered the whole city,\" he said. \"You hold it, clear it, let the locals take over. It’s historically proven. You don’t have to rid Gaza of Hamas to start this.\" The goal, Spencer said, is to give Gazans — and the world — a tangible glimpse of life without Hamas. Days after a ceasefire took effect, Gazans shop in a market in central Gaza Oct. 18, 2025. (TPS-IL) HAMAS DEFENDS EXECUTIONS OF PALESTINIANS AFTER TRUMP ISSUES STERN WARNING TO TERROR GROUP \"You build a little piece of goodness, a little Disneyland, to show everybody what’s possible,\" he said. \"It would also show the countries that are going to provide stabilization forces something they could be doing — stabilizing cleared areas that don’t have Hamas in them.\" Still, he cautioned the concept is no silver bullet. \"You will have areas on the other side of the line where Hamas thinks they have control,\" he said. \"Building something without Hamas is as important to defeating Hamas as it is to showing people there’s a future.\" Inside Hamas-controlled Gaza, fear still defines daily life. \"Since the start of the ceasefire, we are terrified,\" one resident told Fox News Digital, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \"We don’t want to stay under Hamas. It’s very terrifying for us to hear that Jared Kushner said reconstruction will only take place in the areas Hamas does not control. Trump and Netanyahu said Hamas will end, but look what’s happening. They are back, stronger, and we are still trapped. In this still from a verified social media video confirmed to Reuters by a Hamas source, seven men are forced to their knees and shot from behind by Hamas gunmen during public executions in Gaza Oct. 14, 2025. (Reuters) \"There is plenty of food. Yes, in the markets, food is available, all kinds of food,\" he continued. \"All merchandise is available again, and prices are becoming lower and lower. Life is back, but destruction is what we see everywhere.\" US MILITARY OPENS COORDINATION CENTER IN ISRAEL FOR GAZA STABILIZATION AND AID EFFORTS AMID CEASEFIRE For some on this side of the yellow line, the prospect of rebuilding a new Gaza on the other side — even a small one — feels like freedom. Hussam al-Astal, who leads an anti-Hamas militia in Khan Younis, told Fox News Digital, \"We do not seek to rule Gaza, nor do we seek power. Our project, after the rule and collapse of the Hamas-ISIS government, is to secure the people and move them through the transitional phase … to civilian institutions that govern in a way that pleases God, far from their personal interests.\" Hamas terrorists emerge in a show of strength escorting Red Cross vehicles carrying three Israeli hostages to be released as part of the ceasefire deal. (TPS-IL) He accused Hamas of turning its guns inward during the ceasefire. \"We demand the entire international community protect us from Hamas’ terror,\" he said. \"We’re not fighting for someone’s rule. We are fighting for a dignified life. We fight for a new Gaza.\" Multiple sources say Israel has already offered limited support to al-Astal and other anti-Hamas factions on the ground. \"We saw a preview when the Majayda clan, in consort with anti-Hamas fighter Hussam al-Astal and aided by the IDF from the air, repelled Hamas in a localized battle,\" Joseph Braude, president of the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital. \"That’s a small example of what’s likely to happen more broadly — local forces, backed by Israel, pushing out Hamas from the ground up.\" Spencer and Braude agree that the emerging \"two Gazas\" reality isn\u0027t accidental. It’s built into the Trump administration’s 20-point plan.

(Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"We are approaching a new reality in which it’s feasible for reconstruction to begin in a portion of the Strip — the areas behind the yellow line — while fighting continues in the rest of Gaza,\" Braude said. \"Hamas is not a party to the peace process but a belligerent actor. Reconstruction is not contingent on Hamas’ cooperation. It begins where Hamas can no longer operate, while the effort to eliminate its presence continues in other parts of the Strip.\" Braude said the plan envisions \"nascent enclaves of self-rule that gradually evolve into a coalition — the foundation for what could be called a Gazan Interim Transitional Authority.\" He concluded, \"Developing local fighting forces to counter Hamas is a capacity Gazans welcome and Israel and its allies have,\" he said. \"Building a functioning government with continuity, a rules-based system, and institutions — that’s the harder work.\" Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

And at home, the White House launched constructing its new ballroom — much to the ire of many Democrats. Trump said construction started Monday and that the project would be funded privately. The project is estimated to cost $300 million, up from the $200 million estimate first provided in July when the project was unveiled. \"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.

On Monday, Trump signaled he wants to expedite outfitting Australia with nuclear submarines under the trilateral agreement between the U.S., Australia and the U.K. that seeks to enhance Australia’s submarine force to deter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. The agreement, known as AUKUS, stipulates the U.S. will sell up to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia that are scheduled for delivery as soon as 2032. The deal also outlines that Australia and the U.K. will work to build additional attack submarines for Australia\u0027s fleet. However, Trump told reporters that he is looking at equipping Australia with the submarines soon, when asked if he was interested in speeding up the process.

The meeting comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, which escalated when Beijing announced Oct. 9 it would impose export controls on rare-earth magnets. Rare earth magnets are used in products ranging from electric cars to F-35 fighter jets. As a result, Trump said the U.S. would impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, which is slated to take effect Nov. 1. However, Trump has sought to neutralize tension, and has regularly spoken highly of his relationship with Xi in recent weeks. He has said he believes a deal will be reached between the two countries.

A teenager in New Jersey has filed a major lawsuit against the company behind an artificial intelligence (AI) \"clothes removal\" tool that allegedly created a fake nude image of her. The case has drawn national attention because it shows how AI can invade privacy in harmful ways. The lawsuit was filed to protect students and teens who share photos online and to show how easily AI tools can exploit their images.

LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION How the fake nude images were created and shared When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real. The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf. A New Jersey teen is suing the creators of an AI tool that made a fake nude image of her. (iStock) The suit asks the court to delete all fake images and stop the company from using them to train AI models. It also seeks to remove the tool from the internet and provide financial compensation for emotional harm and loss of privacy. The legal fight against deepfake abuse States across the U.S. are responding to the rise of AI-generated sexual content. More than 45 states have passed or proposed laws to make deepfakes without consent a crime. In New Jersey, creating or sharing deceptive AI media can lead to prison time and fines. At the federal level, the Take It Down Act requires companies to remove nonconsensual images within 48 hours after a valid request. Despite new laws, prosecutors still face challenges when developers live overseas or operate through hidden platforms. APPARENT AI MISTAKES FORCE TWO JUDGES TO RETRACT SEPARATE RULINGS The lawsuit aims to stop the spread of deepfake \"clothes-removal\" apps and protect victims’ privacy. (iStock) Why legal experts say this case could set a national precedent Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm. The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice. Is ClothOff still available? Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company\u0027s web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\" On its official website, the company includes a short disclaimer addressing the ethics of its technology. It states, \"Is it ethical to use AI generators to create images? Using AI to create \u0027deepnude\u0027 style images raises ethical considerations. We encourage users to approach this with an understanding of responsibility and respect for others\u0027 privacy, ensuring that the use of undress app is done with full awareness of ethical implications.\" Whether fully operational or partly restricted, ClothOff\u0027s ongoing presence online continues to raise serious legal and moral questions about how far AI developers should go in allowing such image-manipulation tools to exist. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This case could set a national precedent for holding AI companies accountable for misuse of their tools. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Why this AI lawsuit matters for everyone online The ability to make fake nude images from a simple photo threatens anyone with an online presence. Teens face special risks because AI tools are easy to use and share. The lawsuit draws attention to the emotional harm and humiliation caused by such images. Parents and educators worry about how quickly this technology spreads through schools. Lawmakers are under pressure to modernize privacy laws. Companies that host or enable these tools must now consider stronger safeguards and faster takedown systems. What this means for you If you become a target of an AI-generated image, act quickly. Save screenshots, links and dates before the content disappears. Request immediate removal from websites that host the image. Seek legal help to understand your rights under state and federal law. Parents should discuss digital safety openly. Even innocent photos can be misused. Knowing how AI works helps teens stay alert and make safer online choices. You can also demand stricter AI rules that prioritize consent and accountability. Take my quiz: How safe is your online security? Think your devices and data are truly protected?

The case challenges the idea that AI tools are neutral and asks whether their creators share responsibility for harm. We must decide how to balance innovation with human rights. The court\u0027s ruling could influence how future AI laws evolve and how victims seek justice. If an AI tool creates an image that destroys someone\u0027s reputation, should the company that made it face the same punishment as the person who shared it?

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Former Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., lamented that former President Joe Biden’s presidency was influenced by staffers who pushed far-left policies rather than the more moderate positions of his past. Biden served in American politics for decades, but his career ended with a presidency that some argue was co-opted by a liberal agenda that was out of step with American voters. In November 2021, Manchin shared his wish that Biden \"Be normal and stop the chaos,\" warning, \"We can’t go too far left. This is not a center-left or a left country. We are a center, if anything, a little center-right country.\" In 2025, as the Democratic Party still reels from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat and tries to seek a path forward, Manchin offered his analysis of the past few years to the hosts of the \"All-In\" podcast. \"I\u0027m going to be honest with you. Ron Klain, okay? Smart guy, good guy and everything, but he had gone so far to the left and he pushed Joe left,\" Manchin claimed. \"When I first went over to the White House, I said, ‘Mr. President,’ I said ‘You have the most liberal staff that I\u0027ve ever seen.’ First time I went over. And he said, ‘Well, Joe, they tell me I have the most diversified staff.’ I said, ‘We\u0027re not talking about diversity, sir. We\u0027re talking about bats--- crazy. We\u0027re talking about people I\u0027ve known, I\u0027ve worked with in the hallway forever, and I know where they came and where they worked before. These are people real far left.\" ATLANTIC CALLS OUT DEMS FOR FAILING TO TAKE \u0027OWN ADVICE\u0027 AND MODERATE THEIR POLICIES Ron Klain, White House chief of staff, listens during a cabinet meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, July 20, 2021. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Manchin added, \"Ron put that team together. And I know that because I kept saying that ‘your staff is pushing you too far left, Mr. President. You’ve never been this far left.\" The West Virginia politician concluded that while he believes Biden is a good man, Manchin says the President \"lost the will to fight.\" When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Klain said, \"Our agenda at the WH was the agenda the president campaigned on — no more no less. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for it other than Senator Manchin. Every one. The staff were all veterans of the Obama and Clinton WH. I respect Sen. Manchin, but the staff was mainstream Democratic and the agenda was mainstream Democratic.\" Klain added that agenda items such as paid family leave and a child tax credit are \"overwhelmingly supported by the American people.\" Meanwhile, the former Senator said, \"I know how much energy it takes if you\u0027ve got to fight with your staff every day to do the things you want rather than the staff saying, ‘We\u0027ll take care of that, Mr. President.’ Because I would ask him, we’d agree on something, and I\u0027d ask him a week or two later, and nothing had happened, so, I’d know there was no follow-up. You follow? So, I knew Ron was kind of driving the train.\" Later in the same podcast, he gave a summation of his feelings about the Biden presidency, from its hopeful start to its less-than-satisfactory outcome.

Joe Manchin , I-W.Va., lamented the Biden presidency as a missed opportunity for Democrats to wield power moderately. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images) \"I think, ‘Boy, we got it now,\" Manchin said of his initial hopeful attitude regarding Biden’s presidency. \"Boy, was that a letdown. Went far to the left, and I don\u0027t think that was in his heart. But he came out of Iowa bad. Came out of New Hampshire even worse. Went to South Carolina, got resurrected, and within three weeks, everybody drops out. Had to make a deal, I think, with the wrong side of that and try to calm it down, and just for the sake of being president, I think he had to sign up and his people took him to the promised land of the far left — which has no return.\" When asked about how he would have loved to have been in a Democratic primary after Biden relinquished the nomination, he spoke about issues he focuses on, warning that a lack of moderation on immigration would doom the party.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo slammed democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for painting himself as a victim because he is a Muslim, saying the rival mayoral candidate has spent his campaign offending 9/11 families, Jews and various other groups of New Yorkers. \"He claims that he is the victim of attacks because he is a Muslim. Nothing could be further from the truth. He is not a victim, he is the offender,\" Cuomo said Saturday. \"This entire campaign, he has been dividing and attacking and offending different New York groups.\" While speaking at an event in which he received the endorsements of several faith leaders, Cuomo lambasted Mamdani, who he called his \"main opponent.\" Cuomo listed a number of groups he says have been hurt by Mamdani, including Jews, Blacks, Italians, members of the LGBTQ community and even some Muslims. SPARKS FLY AS CUOMO, MAMDANI TEAR INTO EACH OTHER DURING FIERY DEBATE: \u0027TOXIC ENERGY\u0027 Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo slammed rival Zohran Mamdani as the two battle to become mayor of New York City. (Angelina Katsanis/Pool via Reuters; Mike Segar/Reuters) Cuomo first addressed the Jewish community, saying Mamdani had hurt it \"in a truly painful way.\" The former governor recounted a recent interaction with a Jewish New Yorker who said he was afraid of wearing a Star of David in the city. In 2023, the UJA-Federation of New York said in a report there were just over 1.3 million Jews living in New York City. He then took issue with Mamdani\u0027s refusal to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" which many see as a call for violence against Jewish people. Mamdani has faced criticism for his refusal to condemn the phrase early in the mayoral race. The former governor also said his opponent, who could become New York City\u0027s first Muslim mayor, hurt the Sunni Muslim community by advocating for the decriminalization of prostitution. Cuomo added that, according to the Quran, prostitution is haram, which means \"forbidden\" in Arabic. After condemning Mamdani’s gesture toward the Columbus statue and invoking its offense to Italian Americans, Cuomo broadened his criticism. He pointed to a photo of Mamdani with a Ugandan official who backs harsh anti-gay laws, framing it as an affront to the LGBTQ community. New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has been criticized for affiliating with Hasan Piker, a Twitch streamer who said in 2019, \"America deserved 9/11.\" (Reuters/Bing Guan) MAMDANI ACCUSES CUOMO OF \u0027ISLAMOPHOBIC RHETORIC\u0027 AS CONTENTIOUS NYC MAYORAL RACE COMES DOWN TO THE WIRE He didn’t stop there. Mamdani’s friendship with controversial Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, who once said \"America deserved 9/11,\" also drew scrutiny from the former governor. \"You offend 9/11 families. You offend every New Yorker because 9/11 was an attack on all New Yorkers, and it traumatized all New Yorkers. So, no, he\u0027s not the victim. He is the offender, and he has done a great deal of damage,\" Cuomo said. On Friday, Mamdani accused Cuomo of using \"Islamophobic rhetoric\" after the former governor joined a radio show in which the host said Mamdani would be \"cheering\" if New York City faced another 9/11-style attack. \"While my opponents in this race have brought hatred to the forefront, this is just a glimpse of what so many have to endure every day across the city,\" Mamdani said. \"And while it would be easy for us to say that this is not who we are as a city, we know the truth. This is who we have allowed ourselves to become.\" Former New York Gov.

And I think if you’re in a purple district, say you disagree with some of the things that he does and use that to establish your independent cred,\" Bedingfield said. Maher pushed back as he pointed to Cuomo\u0027s criticism of Mamdani\u0027s ties to Uganda, where he was born, due to the country\u0027s treatment of LGBTQ people. Cuomo is running as an independent against Mamdani. \"You make it sound like he’s a little more mainstream than I think he is. I mean, the issue now that Andrew Cuomo is bringing up in New York is that he is a Ugandan citizen. Uganda is a country where they kill homosexuals,\" Maher said. \"I would renounce, if I was the dual citizen with a country whose policy was we kill homosexuals. I would renounce that citizenship,\" Maher said. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, spoke to supporters at a canvass launch event in Prospect Park on Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025.

Isn\u0027t that a basic violation of human rights?\" On the HBO show, Bedingfield told Maher he was buying into a \"fear framework\" that wasn\u0027t good for the country. She also accused Cuomo of \"race baiting\" and said the former governor suggested that he couldn\u0027t be a leader in a \"terror situation.\" Maher pushed back on Bedingfield, suggesting it wasn\u0027t a good look for the Democratic Party. \"He campaigned this week with a guy who was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and served as a character witness for Omar Abdel Rahman, the terrorist who organized it. So Sarah Palin used to say Obama palled around with terrorists, which was bulls---, but I just don’t know if this is a great look for the party,\" Maher said, referring to an image of Mamdani posing alongside Siraj Wahhaj.

MSNBC host Michael Steele also appeared on the panel and said it was ultimately up to New Yorkers to decide. \"My take is, I think what’s being left out in this conversation is probably the most important ingredient — and that is the people of New York.

(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) The foreign minister’s offer to host peace talks between Ukraine and Russia comes after a proposed summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary was shelved. Some analysts say Serbia would be a surprising choice to host the next round of ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine given the historic ties Russia and Serbia share, rooted in cultural and religious connections through the Serbian Orthodox Church.

( Ukrainian Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) While Serbia joined U.N. resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the referenda annexing parts of Ukrainian territory, Belgrade has refused to join Western sanctions targeting Russia over the invasion. Yet Djuric points out that both Ukraine and Russia support Serbia\u0027s territorial integrity regarding Kosovo. Djuric was in New York for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Kosovo. In 1999, a nearly three-month NATO bombing campaign ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Serbian forces were pushed out, but Belgrade still considers Kosovo a Serbian province. PUTIN AND XI DEEPEN TIES AS IRAN, NORTH KOREA LEADERS VISIT BEIJING Some European officials have questioned Serbia’s commitment to European unity. Foreign Minister Djuric countered that Serbia values its place in Europe between East and West, while also noting the country’s close relationship with the U.S. \"Serbia is very proud of its independent foreign and security policy, which has been deeply rooted in the history of our nation and has enabled us to remain independent for centuries, although we are small,\" he said. \"We value very much our strategic partnership growing with the United States for which there is bipartisan consensus in this country. President Donald Trump, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Aug. 15, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska. ( Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"But also, we should bear in mind the fact that President Trump is by far the most popular foreign leader in our country and is the most popular leader for Serbs. I mean, in comparison to all other European countries, President Trump\u0027s popularity in Serbia is unparalleled. More than 71% of the Serbs have a very favorable opinion of the U.S. president and of his policies, which really gives a very fertile ground for the further growth of our relationship.\" Yet Serbia’s ties with China, widely viewed as the United States’ main economic and military competitor on the world stage, have caused some concern in Washington. The U.S. recently sanctioned Serbia\u0027s Russian-owned oil company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), which is Serbia\u0027s main supplier of oil and gasoline. China conducted military exercises in Serbia in July despite stern warnings from the European Union, and Belgrade provides Beijing with a security foothold in Europe. Serbia has also purchased medium- and short-range surface-to-air missile systems from China. Beijing\u0027s biggest penetration into Serbia is in the economic space. It has invested more than $10 billion in infrastructure projects over the last 15 years, according to the Center for European Policy Analysis.

So, they are, as a U.N. Security Council member, also an important partner for us,\" Djuric said. Djuric said great power competition between the U.S. and China is \"above the pay grade of a small Balkan nation\" and that the Serbian government will continue to focus on its economic development.

Neither Hornets officials nor betting companies were made aware of Rozier\u0027s plan, according to the Department of Justice indictment, and Rozier was not listed on the team\u0027s injury report. Deniro Laster then allegedly sold that information to other co-conspirators, and numerous people placed wagers totaling roughly $200,000 on Rozier\u0027s \"under\" prop bets to hit in both parlay and straight wagers. After Rozier played just nine minutes and never returned, the bets won. Rozier and Laster counted cash winnings at Rozier\u0027s home in Charlotte roughly a week later, the indictment says.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! For members of Generation Z, romance can come with a price tag — and a budget, according to a new report. Nearly one in three singles (31%) born between 1997 and 2012 admit they\u0027ve gone on a date just for the free meal, according to an Intuit survey of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted in September. The study found that money is increasingly shaping relationships, from date-night budgets to deciding who pays the bill. Overall, 51% of Americans said they\u0027re dating less due to economic concerns, with Gen Z hit hardest at 58%. Yet many are redefining a \"good\" date around affordability and creativity. GEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS \u0027TERRIBLE\u0027 TREND EMERGES \"For Gen Z, financial habits and ambition are becoming part of the new love language,\" said Ashleigh Ewald, a Georgia Tech public policy student in her twenties. \"Money and financial security have become major forces in dating because they represent stability.\" Many Gen Z singles say their dating lives are shaped by finances. (iStock) Nearly half of Gen Z and millennials say they don\u0027t feel financially secure, according to a Deloitte survey released earlier this year. Ewald said inflation and cost-of-living pressures have made creative, budget-friendly dates more common, from home-cooked dinners to shared side hustles. \"A girl\u0027s gotta eat.\" Almost half of Americans say the sweet spot for a first-date budget is between $50 and $100, Intuit found. For 22-year-old Jacksonville, Florida, media professional Katie Fites, the trend rings true.

Katie Fites told Fox News Digital that she \"wouldn\u0027t go out with just anyone for a free meal. The risk usually outweighs the reward.\" (Katie Fites) \"If you can\u0027t afford a $15 drink, don\u0027t ask someone out,\" she said. \"I want to go out with someone ambitious who knows what they want. It doesn\u0027t mean they have to make a lot of money, but they should have direction.\" Like many of her generation, Fites said she prefers low-pressure, affordable dates — grabbing coffee, walking on the beach or getting a drink instead of an expensive dinner. SPLITTING A RESTAURANT BILL WITH FRIENDS? EXPERT SHARES \u0027MOST DESIRABLE\u0027 APPROACH Jason Lee, founder of the relationship app LoveTrack, which provides date ideas, conversation starters and birthday and anniversary reminders, said members of Gen Z are more frugal and creative when it comes to date nights. Some of the most popular date ideas on the app are free or low-cost, such as scavenger hunts, picnics and movie nights at home, he said. Licensed therapist Allison Guilbault, who counsels Gen Z clients in New York City, said splitting tabs, sharing Ubers and buying their own drinks has also become the standard. \"I don\u0027t even think they notice if their date is cheap the way that my peers and I would absolutely notice,\" the 44-year-old said. Younger daters are more transparent about income, spending and saving, according to some experts. (iStock) Money, however, often becomes the \"third wheel,\" according to Intuit. A third of Americans have ended a relationship over finances, and 44% of Gen Z daters say they\u0027d only go out with someone who earns more than they do. Sabrina Romanoff, a New York-based psychologist and relationship expert with dating app Hily, said these financial dynamics aren\u0027t new, but they\u0027ve intensified. \"Historically, women tended to date men of equal or greater education or income,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Today, dating has become increasingly transactional, she added. \"In the past, a first date might have led to the hope of a future together or a potential relationship, whereas, now more cynical daters may have lower expectations, such as a free dinner or free drink.\" A Hily survey found that more than half — 57% of women and 63% of men — would stop seeing someone who can\u0027t manage money responsibly, and about a third of women and 37% of men even find frugality attractive. Nearly half of Gen Z and millennials say they don\u0027t feel financially secure. (iStock) \"The goal of getting free meals, drinks or even vacations was prevalent when I was in college,\" Guilbault said. She recalled the early 2000s \"Sex and the City\" era in New York City, when she and her friends would often hustle men to pick up the tab for dinner or drinks.

More than half keep separate accounts, preferring autonomy to joint control, Intuit found — and they don\u0027t dance around the \"money talk.\" \"We\u0027re asking the salary question when we get exclusive because we\u0027ve learned that love doesn\u0027t pay the rent,\" said Gen Z money expert Taylor Price. Talking about money early in a relationship isn\u0027t taboo for Gen Z.

And I used to always go there and sit and just meditate, listen to the water and stuff.\" ‘BLIND SIDE’ ACTOR WHO PLAYED MICHAEL OHER SAYS ‘BLOWS THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN’ FROM BOTH SIDES ARE ‘SHOCKING’ \"There\u0027s one day I\u0027m sitting there on the wall, and I\u0027m just listening to the water vibe, and then I wake up underwater,\" he recalled. \"So I literally passed out, fell off the wall, and it was like a 12-foot drop, but the water was only three feet deep. I didn\u0027t know that at the time. Well, thank God it was three feet deep, because I can\u0027t swim.\" Aaron said he believed he was saved by a voice he heard telling him to stand up. \"I literally woke up underwater,\" he recalled. \"I didn\u0027t have a chance to take a breath and brace myself.

But while I\u0027m underwater, I hear this voice say, ‘Stand up.’ And so I stand, like I start trying to get to my feet. The water is pushing me into the rocks, and I\u0027m kinda like hitting my head up against something.

He said he later learned that his fall may have been caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, a complication from extremely high blood sugar levels. \"The Left Behind\" star told Fox News Digital that he had been seen sitting on the wall by a passing couple who turned around and came back to check on him after hearing a splash. \"They were like, ‘Are you alright?’ And that\u0027s when I screamed, and so they called 911,\" he said. Aaron recalled that he was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors conducted a full-body examination on him and discovered that he had an infection in one of his big toes that had spread to his bone. \"I was in the hospital for a few weeks getting IV antibiotics,\" Aaron said. \"I almost lost my toe, but thankfully I didn\u0027t. They just cut a piece of it off, and it had to heal.\" Aaron, who is a devout Christian, shared that he believed that he had a pivotal encounter with God while he was recovering. \"God visited me, and He was like, ‘Do you want to die?’ And I said, ‘No.’ And I didn\u0027t know who I\u0027m answering, but I hear this voice talking to me. And I said, ‘No.’ And He goes, ‘So what are you gonna do?’ And I said, ‘I need help.’\" Aaron said his health transformation was due to a wake-up call from God. (Courtesy of Quinton Aaron) The actor said he believed God \"rewired something\" in him during his recovery. \"From that moment on, I couldn’t stand the taste of sugar,\" he said. \"It’s not permanent, because today I eat sugar again, but at that time, when I said, ‘I need help,’ it was like He knew what the help was, and He just erased it from my memory.\" After leaving the hospital, Aaron adopted intermittent fasting, portion control and cutting out sugar as the foundation of his new health plan. \"I stopped overeating,\" he said. \"I started intermittent fasting, and I cut out sugars, and so with just those three things, the weight just started dropping off tremendously.\" Aaron said doctors told him his diabetes and elevated blood sugar contributed to his fall.

(Amanda Edwards/Getty Images) \"It wasn\u0027t an overnight process,\" Aaron continued. \"It definitely took some work, but my mindset was at that point where it was like, I got a lot of things I want to live for. At the time, I was single. I\u0027ve always wanted to be married and have kids. And I\u0027m like, ‘What condition am I gonna be in if I had kids? I gotta make these changes.’\" \"So I started taking it serious,\" he continued. \"Once you change it up here, everything else falls into place, because you now have the mindset that you need to get to where you\u0027re trying to go. And for me, that was the biggest part.\" \"I said, God has a sense of humor because I felt like He could have done a lot more subtle than knocking me off the wall into the water and knowing I can\u0027t swim,\" Aaron added with a laugh. WATCH: ‘BLIND SIDE’ STAR QUINTON AARON SHARES HOW HE LOST OVER 200 POUNDS AFTER A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE Video Aaron acknowledged that years of depression and emotional eating contributed to his weight struggles. The actor suffered a tragic loss in September 2008 when his mother, Laura Aaron, died from a heart attack at the age of 44. At the time, Aaron had recently been cast in his breakthrough role as Michael Oher in the 2009 biographical sports drama \"The Blind Side\" after a nationwide search for the right actor to portray the NFL player’s story. The movie also starred Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw as Oher\u0027s adoptive parents, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy. \"The Blind Side\" became a major commercial and critical success, receiving Oscar nominations for best picture and best actress for Bullock, who took home the trophy. The 61-year-old star also won the Golden Globe Award for best actress. Aaron earned rave reviews for his performance and the role launched his Hollywood career. Looking back, the actor told Fox News Digital that he had compartmentalized his pain over Laura\u0027s death to take advantage of the opportunities that were coming his way.

I miss my mama,\" Aaron said. \"I couldn\u0027t share any of that with her, and it just started eating at me.

I didn\u0027t turn to those things.\" Aaron said that he and Bullock have stayed close over the years. (Kevin Mazur/VF11/WireImage/Getty Images) Aaron shared that he has stayed close with Bullock, who reached out to him during his hospital stay as well as after he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2019. \"She\u0027s always been amazing, and she\u0027s been a huge part of my life since the movie,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve had such an amazing friendship over the years that still goes on.\" \"That\u0027s my mama, you know, that\u0027s my on-screen mama,\" he added. \"I always got her back.

A couple years later, I had another health thing, because I had put on some weight. My weight would go up and down over the years.\" He said his new motivation comes from his marriage to wife Margarita, who he wed in December 2024, and his desire to \"break the generational curse\" of diabetes and heart disease. The actor weighed 575 at his heaviest. (Courtesy of Quinton Aaron) \"It\u0027s about making sure that when I have my children, they don\u0027t fall into that stigma of the unhealthy habits that has plagued me and my family for generations,\" he said. \"My mom was diagnosed with congestive heart failure at the age of 37. I got diagnosed at 35. She died at 44. I ain\u0027t trying to die no time soon. I ain\u0027t trying to die in my forties and my fifties. I\u0027m trying to be here for the long run.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Cognitive decline is typically considered a hallmark of aging, but research suggests that not everyone is susceptible. A study from Northwestern University looked at a group of 80-year-olds who appeared to have memory skills on par with 50-year-olds, and the researchers aimed to understand the differences in their brains. These people were classified as \"SuperAgers,\" defined as those 80 and older who have memories of those 30 years their junior, according to a university press release. People in this category score at least nine out of 15 on a delayed word recall test. 7 STEPS TO ‘SUPER-AGING’ ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY \"SuperAgers\" are defined as those 80 and older who have memories of those 30 years younger. (iStock) The \"SuperAger\" term was coined by Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, founder of the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer\u0027s Disease at Northwestern, in the late 1990s. In studying nearly 300 SuperAgers for the past 25 years, the Northwestern researchers identified some common traits, including being \"highly social and outgoing\" and having strong interpersonal relationships. \"It\u0027s really what we\u0027ve found in their brains that\u0027s been so earth-shattering for us,\" noted co-author Dr. Sandra Weintraub, professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences and neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in the release. The researchers found that some of the participants\u0027 brains showed no buildup of amyloid and tau proteins (plaques and tangles), the toxic substances that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. (iStock) The research team examined 77 of the SuperAgers’ donated brains after they died. They found that some of the brains showed no buildup of amyloid and tau proteins (plaques and tangles), the toxic substances that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Other brains did have the proteins, but they didn’t appear to have affected cognitive health. STUDY REVEALS WHY ‘SUPER AGERS’ MAINTAIN ‘OUTSTANDING MEMORY’ INTO THEIR 80S \"What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,\" Weintraub said in the release. \"One is resistance: they don\u0027t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don\u0027t do anything to their brains.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Unlike most aging brains, SuperAgers did not experience significant thinning of the cortex, which is the brain’s outer layer. They also had a thicker anterior cingulate cortex, the region of the brain involved in decision-making, emotion and motivation. They were also found to have a greater number of \"von Economo neurons,\" specialized cells associated with social behavior, and larger entorhinal neurons, which are crucial for memory. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The study outcome was published as a perspective article in Alzheimer\u0027s \u0026 Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer\u0027s Association. The SuperAgers shared common traits, including being \"highly social and outgoing\" and having strong interpersonal relationships. (iStock) \"Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile,\" said Weintraub. \"This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life.\" Armed with this information about the commonalities among SuperAgers, the researchers hope to develop new ways to boost cognitive resilience and prevent or delay Alzheimer’s and other dementias, they noted. TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings to Fox News Digital. \"The answer is a combination of genetic predisposition as well as continuing to keep exercising the brain like a muscle — both socially and intellectually,\" a doctor said. (iStock) \"The buildup of senile plaques — beta amyloid and tau — did not impact neuronal function in those who continued to do very well in terms of thinking, memory and decision-making,\" he noted. \"Those with positive outcomes shared continued socialization, interaction and a high level of intellectual engagement.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Before the iconoclastic chaos of 2020, when historic statues were toppled both legally and via riot, the debate over Confederate monuments was generally a respectful one. But today, as a new art exhibit in Los Angeles shows, the left has replaced respect with barbaric desecration. ‘Monuments’ is a new show at the Brick in association with the Museum of Contemporary Art, and it features removed Confederate statues on display, some still covered in graffiti from protesters, some given historical context and in one case, a pure mutilation. The New Yorker, in a glowing review, described ‘Monuments’ as \"at once an act of carnivalesque retribution and a recognition of the Confederacy’s zombie-like persistence.\" Let’s take both of these ideas in their turn, starting with retribution, by asking, retribution against whom, exactly? CONFEDERATE MONUMENT DISMANTLED AFTER SPARKING DEBATE, WILL BE MOVED TO VETERANS PARK The statues have already been removed. The men and women depicted in them have already had their place in history erased. This mockery, this retribution, is not directed against them, but rather against anyone who believes that our historical monuments should be protected, not destroyed. A worker secures the statue of Confederate Naval officer Matthew Fontaine Maury to a truck on Monument Avenue, Thursday, July 2, 2020, in Richmond, Va. Maury was better known for his work in oceanography and other sciences before the Civil War. His statue is the second removed since a new state law was enacted on July first. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) One statue is titled ‘Confederate Women of Baltimore,’ and depicts two women holding a dying Confederate soldier. Originally an expression of the terrible losses of America’s deadliest war, it is now displayed alongside myriad photographs of black mothers cradling wounded children in modern urban settings. The message is clear, it is that whatever pain the Daughters of the Confederacy who commissioned the statue or the actual sculptor sought to embody, they should just shut up about it. DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP TAKES ON SMITHSONIAN’S LEFTY BIAS AND STATUE-TOPPLING LIBS MELT DOWN The most grotesque of the works is called \"Unmanned Drone,\" it was formerly an equestrian statue of Gen. Thomas ‘Stonewell’ Jackson in Virginia, but the artist, Kara Walker used a plasma cutter to tear the statue apart and reshape it into a hideous monster. Brick Director Hamza Walker said of the piece, \"Ideologically it’s an affront, aesthetically it’s an affront.\" So again I ask, an affront to whom? Is the idea to offend people? If so, why? There is a strong element of projection in all of this. Many of the very same people who are celebrating ‘Monuments’ believe that President Donald Trump’s new White House ballroom is meant as a middle finger to the left. Maybe that’s because that is exactly what exhibits like ‘Monuments’ actually are to the right. Video This art says, \u0027Not only did we take down your statues, usually without anybody voting on it, but now we are going to mock, mutilate and desecrate them to rub it in,\" while all the high-minded art journals call it stunning and brave. ‘Monuments’ brings to mind the Nazi’s Degenerate Art Exhibit of 1937 in which works of modern art deemed insulting to German values were displayed for the purpose of publicly demeaning them, just as the statues in Los Angeles are being demeaned. Viewers are meant to come away with a deeper hatred of the Confederacy and, more than that, an almost inhuman tolerance for desecrating works of art that once were crafted by loving and talented hands. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ANNOUNCES IT WILL RESTORE, REINSTATE STATUE HONORING CONFEDERATE GENERAL ALBERT PIKE So yes, a carnival of retribution this art show most definitely is. But what about the other part of the New Yorker description, the \"Confederacy’s zombie-like persistence?\" Allow me to suggest that almost the only people obsessed with the Confederacy in 2025 are progressives. There is no neoconfederate movement to confront, nobody is trying to secede or defend slavery. Rather, it is the left who constantly point to the stars and bars as if they have anything to do with today’s conservative movement. HEGSETH ANNOUNCES RETURN OF CONFEDERATE MEMORIAL TO ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, REMOVED BY \u0027WOKE LEMMINGS\u0027 The original removal of the statues was an abominable act of damnatio memoriae, or destruction of memory, a practice dating back to Ancient Egypt. But ‘Monuments’ is far, far worse, it is mean spirited, meant as ritual humiliation. The good news is that there are two sides in this fight, as the Trump administration has already restored two confederate statues in Washington, D.C. And it\u0027s a fight worth having, between those who want to build and those who want to destroy, those who want to celebrate our history and those who seek to desecrate it. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Thankfully, all but the massacred Stonewall Jackson statue will go back to storage after this exhibit, no longer to be the butt of a spiteful joke. One day, if good people stay true and work hard, we might get them all the way back to their original podiums. The fight for the past is never really about the past. It is about the present and the future, and it is a fight that we cannot afford to lose.

Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA guard and coach Damon Jones were among those arrested by the FBI as part of an illegal gambling and sports betting probe Thursday. The investigation was tied to the members of the La Cosa Nostra crime families.

In 1920, eight members of the Chicago White Sox were indicted by a Chicago grand jury for fixing the 1919 World Series. It is known as the \"Black Sox Scandal.\" The jury returned a not guilty verdict on the players, but White Sox owner Charles Comiskey suspended the players, including \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson. A year after the suspension, they were banned permanently by new baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. In 1946, Hockey Hall of Famer Babe Pratt was suspended for gambling. He was reinstated weeks later, with the NHL Board of Governors issuing a warning that any further instances of gambling would lead to a lifetime suspension for a player. In 1948, two years after the NHL Board of Governors\u0027 warning, Billy Taylor and Don Gallinger were issued lifetime bans for betting on games. In 1951, four members of the Adolph Rupp-coached Kentucky Wildcats were accused of taking bribes from gamblers for an NIT game against Loyola in the 1948-1949 season. There were 35 active and former players accused of fixing at least 86 games between 1947 and 1951. An NCAA investigation found several violations, which led to the cancellation of Kentucky’s 1952-53 season. In 1989, Cincinnati Reds legend Pete Rose received a lifetime ban for gambling on games. Rose was found to have placed numerous bets on the Reds to win from 1985-1987 while he played and managed the team. He admitted to gambling in 2004 after years of claiming his innocence. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred posthumously removed Rose from the permanently ineligible list in May 2025, months after his death, allowing Rose to finally be considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Rose is baseball’s all-time leader in hits with 4,256.

Head coach Dan Henning informed school officials upon hearing allegations of players placing bets with bookies and resigned. No evidence of point-shaving was found. In 2007, assistant coach Rick Tocchet was placed on two years of probation after pleading guilty to conspiracy and promoting gambling as an assistant coach with the Phoenix Coyotes. He was reinstated by the NHL the following season. Also, initially implicated in a gambling scheme titled \"Operation Slapshot\" involving a New Jersey-based ring were several players; Wayne Gretzky’s wife, Janet Jones; and Gretzky’s former agent and-then Coyotes general manager Michael Barnett. Tocchet is currently the head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers. In 2008, NBA referee Tim Donaghy pleaded guilty to wire fraud and transmitting betting information for taking thousands of dollars from a gambler in exchange for inside tips on games, including games he worked. He was sentenced by a federal judge to 15 months behind bars. In 2023, golfer Phil Mickelson was alleged to have wagered more than $1 billion over the last three decades in a book written by gambler Billy Walters. In the book, Walters wrote that Mickelson wanted to bet $400,000 on the 2012 Ryder Cup when he played for the United States. The six-time major winner denied betting on the Ryder Cup and wrote in a social media post that he has stopped gambling. Mickelson said he crossed the line from moderation to addiction. In 2023, Ottawa Senators forward Shane Pinto was suspended 41 games for sports gambling. The NHL said there was no evidence that Pinto bet on hockey, and Pinto did not reveal any details upon his return to the Senators. NBA PLAYER TERRY ROZIER\u0027S LAWYER SLAMS FBI AFTER ARREST Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani (17) with translator Ippei Mizuhara against the Chicago White Sox during a spring training game at Camelback Ranch-Glendale. (Mark J. Rebilas/USA Today Sports) In March 2024, the Los Angeles Dodgers fired Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter and close friend of newly acquired two-way star Shohei Ohtani, following reports regarding his ties to an illegal bookmaker. Three months later, Mizuhara pleaded guilty in federal court to bank and tax fraud for stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani’s bank account. He spent the money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, plus $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own medical bills. Mizuhara capitalized on the language barrier to keep Ohtani’s financial advisers from understanding their client, and, at times, Mizuhara even impersonated the player to the bank to prolong the fraud. In April 2024, the NBA banned Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter after a league probe found he disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and wagered on games. Porter even bet on the Raptors to lose. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Porter’s actions \"blatant.\" The investigation started after unusual gambling patterns about Porter’s performance on March 20, 2024, against the Sacramento Kings. The league determined Porter gave a bettor information about his own health status prior to that game and said that another individual — known to be an NBA bettor — placed an $80,000 bet that Porter would not hit the numbers set for him in parlays through an online sports book. That bet would have won $1.1 million. In June 2024, San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned for life by MLB for betting on baseball. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 with a legal sportsbook in 2022 and 2023. The 24-year-old Venezuelan, with 149 games of major league experience, became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling. Also in 2024, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues, and three minor leaguers were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona and infielder José Rodríguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000. Saalfrank and Rodríguez played previously in the majors.

(Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, file) In February 2025, umpire Pat Hoberg was fired by MLB for sharing his legal sports gambling accounts with a friend who bet on baseball games and for intentionally deleting electronic messages pertinent to the league’s investigation. While MLB said the probe did not uncover evidence Hoberg personally bet on baseball or manipulated games, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill recommended on May 24, 2024, that Hoberg be fired. Manfred upheld Hill’s decision. Among the highest-rated umpires at judging the strike zone, Hoberg could apply for reinstatement no earlier than 2026 spring training. MLB said the friend made 141 baseball bets between April 2, 2021, and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling almost $214,000 with an overall win of nearly $35,000. Eight of the bets involved games where Hoberg was working. In July 2025, Major League Baseball placed Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz on non-disciplinary paid leave due to a gambling probe. Nearly a month later, two-time American League Reliever of the Year Emmanuel Clase joined him. MLB extended Clase and Ortiz’s paid leave \"until further notice while MLB continues its investigation.\" There was no update on the gambling probe at the time of this writing. In September 2025, the NCAA announced it was investigating potential violations of sports betting rules involving 13 former men’s basketball players who competed for Eastern Michigan, Temple, Arizona State, New Orleans, North Carolina A\u0026T and Mississippi Valley State. The NCAA’s integrity monitoring program and network of sources flagged text messages and direct messages on social media platforms and revealed unusual betting activities for regular-season games. The violations include student-athletes betting on and against their own teams, sharing information with third parties for purposes of sports betting, manipulating scoring or outcomes and/or refusing to participate in the investigation.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Dealing with aging requires a lot of adaptation and planning, which can be stressful, costly and time-consuming. Not dealing with it can be even worse, leading to accidents, more costs and even death. As you — or your loved ones – age, here are some things to plan for to make the process easier and safer. Fall-proof your home The CDC reports that around 25% of older adults – more than 14 million — fall each year, with approximately 3 million emergency room visits and 1 million hospitalizations. The bedroom, bathroom and stairs are top locations where falling accidents occur. Adding lighting, making sure that there aren’t \"trip traps\" like movable throw rugs or cords around, and adding grab bars and handrails are good steps for prevention. Aging causes new obstacles in the way you live, but being proactive can help reduce frustration and improve safety and your quality of life. (Getty Images) Scot Cheben, author of \"Eldercare: Helping Businesses Support Employees Who Are Caregivers,\" also suggests making sure that lighting is accessible from the bed and at the top and bottom of any stairs, as well as putting a whistle in the bedroom and in the shower or bathtub. WHAT DENZEL WASHINGTON TAUGHT THIS RETIRED PASTOR ABOUT FAITH To create a safe environment, you may even need to find a new living situation that removes stairs and has fewer hazards. Taking classes to improve balance and strength can help prevent falls. And there are even new class offerings across the country that teach you how to fall safely. Monitoring driving Nobody likes to lose independence, and aging family members often fight to drive for as long as possible. But if you wait too long to stop driving, it can be dangerous for your loved ones – and others, too. Video Vision and reflex issues, getting lost, and missing or not understanding signage can all be signs that it is time to retire the car keys. WHAT’S THE RIGHT TIME TO GET YOUR KIDS OFF THE FAMILY PAYROLL? There are quizzes and self-assessments that can help you with evaluation, like this one from AAA. Cheben suggests encouraging family members to do an \"unannounced\" test drive for evaluation. Now that Uber, Lyft and even driverless transportation options like Waymo exist, there are more options for older Americans to retain independence without having to be in the driver’s seat (although, keep in mind the tech limitations discussed below, and find ways to assist your loved ones, such as ordering transportation for them, if they can’t do it themselves). Video Shore-up information access While technology can help make our lives easier, for aging Americans who have memory problems, technology can become an obstacle. I UPDATED MY WILL. HERE’S WHY YOU SHOULD, TOO This becomes a bigger issue as many companies are directing their customer service and other functions to websites and online portals. Make sure that you have someone that you trust with your sensitive information and financial accounts available to both help you navigate technology and make sure you are not getting scammed, as technology scams often target aging individuals. Also, ensure that your trusted helper has access to your passwords and important information. You can do this through a legacy planning kit, like a Future File system, which shares your information and wishes. Video Start to downsize We Americans love our stuff, and the longer we live, the more stuff we seem to have! But also, as we age, we may need to downsize our homes or move into assisted living, CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Once we are gone, it is often a large project that loved ones must go through in terms of organizing and disposing of personal effects. Make it a practice to do yearly or twice-yearly purges. Whether you have a yard sale, donate to charity, gift personal effects to loved ones or otherwise, this will help keep your home manageable.

While there are a lot of wonderful, caring people who work in these facilities, there are also some who take advantage and prey on the elderly, particularly as people lose cognition.

One of the Democratic Party’s top potential 2028 figures will stump for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger on Sunday. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has notably made a lane to the right of far-left Democratic Party figures like New York Assemb. Zohran Mamdani, will rally with Spanberger in the crucial Hampton Roads area. The former Virginia congresswoman plans to hold multiple rallies in the Tidewater alone before Election Day, including another with former President Barack Obama across the ‘roads’ in Norfolk. \"Governor Shapiro this weekend is headed to New Jersey and Virginia to help elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger; two more Democratic governors who will focus every day on getting stuff done, delivering results for hardworking families and protecting freedom in their states,\" Shapiro campaign spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Friday. 2028 HOPEFUL CHALLENGES TRUMP\u0027S JUVENILE SURGERY BAN WHILE OPPOSING WOMEN\u0027S SPORTS BILL RESTRICTIONS Pennsylvania Gov.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey as she hopes to keep Trenton in Democratic hands. Shapiro – who has announced he will run for reelection to Harrisburg in 2026 and has not officially indicated interest in a presidential bid – is one of several Democrats whose names repeatedly come up in such conversation – including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear. He was also the reported runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Kamala Harris\u0027 2024 veepstakes. Shapiro lambasted antisemitic behavior at the University of Pennsylvania following the Hamas attack on Israel, while separately adding of Mamdani’s view of the Jewish State: \"You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can’t leave room for that to just sit there.\" THE ONLY TWO DEMS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 2025 ARE FORMER ROOMMATES WITH MIRRORING POLITICAL CAREERS Video While Shapiro has faced criticism from Republicans in his own state for supporting former Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-era shutdowns and for the current budget impasse, he’s also been a rare Democrat to earn praise from some in the GOP. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee in New Jersey’s sweeps, namedropped Shapiro favorably enough times that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka – then running for governor – suggested he cross the Delaware and run in the Keystone State instead. \"[Pennsylvania doesn’t] have a property tax crisis [like New Jersey], they don’t have a business climate crisis, they don’t have an energy crisis,\" Ciattarelli said, contrasting the two neighbors.

But he can\u0027t change the Constitution with an executive order, and the Constitution gives the authority to set our election rules to the states.\" Shapiro said.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! With less than two weeks before critical elections across the country, Democrats have tough questions to grapple with about their messaging and whether they can navigate the growing movement in their party that is embracing or downplaying political violence, attorney and political commentator Kaitlin Puccio told Fox News Digital. \"We do hear a lot of just the Democrats are against Trump, but we don\u0027t hear a lot of what they\u0027re actually for, which is problematic. And it kind of seems to me like they don\u0027t really have a cohesive message,\" Puccio, adjunct professor at Fordham Law and the director of the Art and Bioethics Initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics and Human Rights, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. Puccio said the ‘No Kings’ protests last week, where several examples of promoting violence went viral on social media, show a \"fracture\" in the Democratic Party that mainstream elected officials will have to contend with. Additionally, messaging at those rallies lacked substance, Puccio explained. CHICAGO SCHOOLS SILENT ON PUNISHMENT OR PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF TEACHER WHO MOCKED CHARLIE KIRK\u0027S DEATH People participate in a \"No Kings\" national day of protest in Boston Oct. 18, 2025. (Getty) \"It\u0027s mostly, ‘We are against Trump.’ OK, but, specifically, what are you against? What is the specific policy that you are against?\" Puccio said. \"\u0027No Kings’: great. But we don\u0027t have a king. We all know that. We\u0027re not supposed to take this phrase literally, but what about the policies that are in place right now do you think are authoritarian? And what do you want instead? So, we\u0027re hearing a lot of slogans and phrases and kind of catchphrases. And really that leaves the message without substance.\" Questions about Democrats\u0027 support for political violence have been front and center in recent weeks after Virginia Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones was outed for past texts fantasizing about killing a Republican colleague and wishing death on that colleague’s children. \"I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s lost on voters that there are these horrible texts that came out recently from Jay Jones. And the strange thing is that there are very few people who are condemning these texts,\" Puccio said, noting that prominent Democrats, particularly in Virginia, have refused to call on Jones to drop out of the race.

(Amy Lemus/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \"But I think the reason for that is that the party of tolerance, right, the Democrats, is actually, it\u0027s become a very intolerant party,\" Puccio added. \"So, if you have people condemning these texts, this sort of violent political rhetoric and things like that, they don\u0027t want to be alienated by their own party. Look at what they\u0027ve done or tried to do to John Fetterman. When he tries to think for himself instead of having the party tell him what to think, they ostracize him. I think that is kind of the reason that we\u0027re in this weird place with our leaders, because everyone is kind of being quiet.\" In addition to Jones, Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner has faced scrutiny over advocating political violence in the past and a tattoo that resembles a Nazi Germany symbol.

(Maxine Wallace/The Washington Post/Getty Images) Puccio told Fox News Digital Platner\u0027s apology seemed to show remorse compared to the reaction from Jones, which could serve as a blueprint going forward on how Democrats can acknowledge past mistakes. \"The point is that every situation has to be evaluated separately, but the conversation still has to be had over what to do within our Democratic Party about this violent rhetoric, which is, it\u0027s basically being accepted right now,\" Puccio said. \"What we\u0027re about to see, I don\u0027t know how long it\u0027s going to take, but I do think there\u0027s going to be a shift toward the middle because I think there is going to be a realization that we are leaving out. And by ‘we,’ I mean all Americans in general were forgetting from both sides of the political aisle about the middle.\" While Democrats are expected to perform strongly in next year\u0027s midterms, given that, historically, the party not in power does well in those elections, Republicans have been closing the gap in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections being held in early November, which could send a signal that Democrats aren\u0027t in as strong of a position as many experts think. Puccio said today\u0027s Democratic Party is \"unrecognizable,\" which will hopefully push leaders to come out forcefully and take back control. \"I think that there will be this realization that the loudest voices on either side of the political aisle are not necessarily representative of the entire party. And I think that people are going to be forced to say no to this kind of uncivil discourse that we\u0027re seeing because people, we citizens, are going to get very tired of seeing our leaders behave in very childish and, frankly, disrespectful ways toward each other,\" Puccio said. \"These are not supposed to be the way our elected leaders act. And I would hope that there emerge some actual leaders and not just politicians in the future who recognize that they need to speak to everyone and not a small niche in their party.\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Seven out of nine universities that the Trump administration solicited for feedback on its Compact for Academic Excellence in Education have rejected the plan, while two others remain noncommittal. The administration sent the compact to universities on Oct. 1, soliciting responses from the University of Arizona, MIT, Vanderbilt University, Brown University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia. The compact\u0027s principles include merit-based admissions and hiring practices regardless of race, sex, political orientation, ethnicity and nationality, a commitment to freedom of ideas \"abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" recognizing biological sex for the purpose of athletics, restrooms and locker rooms, institutional political neutrality, along with a measure about financial responsibility and some restrictions on admissions for foreign students.

The first Rocky film helped launch his film career and earned him Oscar nominations for best original screenplay and best actor.

The Trump administration said it could soon deport Salvadoran illegal immigrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the African nation of Liberia after reaching an agreement with that country, according to a Department of Homeland Security filing Friday. The court filing said that Abrego Garcia could be sent to the West African nation as soon as Oct. 31 to fulfill a standing deportation order against him. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 protection finding and a court order barring his removal to his home country. His case has become a focal point in the clash between Trump’s hardline deportation agenda and Democratic efforts to block removals. ABREGO GARCIA RELEASED FROM JAIL, WILL RETURN TO MARYLAND TO AWAIT TRIAL Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025 (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The filing noted that Abrego Garcia’s attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would prosecute or torture him if he were removed there and that Liberia is not on that list. \"Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent,\" the filing said. The filing said the country\u0027s national language is English, its constitution \"provides robust protections for human rights,\" and Liberia is \"committed to the humane treatment of refugees.\" DHS said in the filing that it has received diplomatic assurances from Liberia about the humane treatment of people removed there. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia blasted the administration’s latest move as political retribution, arguing the latest deportation plan is part of a pattern of punitive deportation tactics. \"After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,\" attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

Van Hollen flew to El Salvador in April in a publicized visit to meet Abrego Garcia in prison and has led the effort to get him released. \"The Trump Administration has been desperately shopping for faraway countries they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to in order to deny his constitutional due process right to defend himself against the charges they have brought,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. Kilmar Abrego Garcia meets with Sen. Van Hollen, D-Md., in El Salvador. (X / @ChrisVanHollen) \"Clearly, Trump’s cronies want to avoid answering for the claim that they are engaged in a vindictive prosecution against Abrego Garcia, after a federal judge concluded earlier this month that his prosecution ‘may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS due to Abrego’s successful challenge of his unlawful deportation in Maryland.’ Kilmar must be allowed his day in court to fight for his rights,\" the senator said. Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and was issued a deportation order in 2019. Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13. Trump administration officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although some top Trump officials said he was correctly removed and contended he\u0027s a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. READ THE FILING. APP USERS CLICK HERE One immigration judge in 2019 found that Garcia had not sufficiently refuted evidence of MS-13 affiliation and was thus removable to anywhere other than El Salvador because of a threat from a rival gang. The latest move to deport him comes as Abrego Garcia remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania. A federal judge in Maryland previously barred his immediate deportation while reviewing claims that the government is retaliating against him for successfully challenging his wrongful removal earlier this year.

The scheme resulted in victims losing at least $7.15 million dating back to April 2019, according to the Department of Justice. With successful NBA careers, though, both playing and on the sidelines, one may wonder what could lead them to be allegedly wrapped up in such schemes. \"Well, they\u0027re risk-takers. Athletes like that, they’ve got a lot of adrenaline,\" Meyer Lansky II, the famous mobster\u0027s grandson, speculated in a Fox News Digital in a recent interview. \"They think they can not only have millions to be paid by a team, but they can make more with their gambling, too. Or they have an addiction to gambling. There\u0027s a lot of people like that. They just want to get involved with that.

(Soobum Im/Imagn Images) WHO ARE CHAUNCEY BILLUPS, TERRY ROZIER AND DAMON JONES? NBA SUBJECTS ARRESTED IN ILLEGAL GAMBLING PROBE Lansky added that there is a potential sense of power from the athletes themselves. \"I think anybody that gets an extraordinary amount of money, and they\u0027ve got a lot of fans behind them, yeah, they can get to the point where they\u0027re just blind to ‘Nothing can happen to me. Why don\u0027t I just do this?’ I do think that with any background, not just sports. It\u0027s a powerful thing. Money and power and fame, it takes over sometimes,\" he said. As for the mafia, \"sports was always a big thing,\" according to Lansky. \"It was pretty easy to fix. It\u0027s always been beneficial…\" he said. \"Yeah, I think it\u0027s pretty easy to access that. You can do it because, if you\u0027re in the casinos, you have surveillance and people watching, and that\u0027s a lot riskier than it would be for sports betting.\" With the legalization of gambling throughout the country, it is much easier for athletes to get involved in harming the integrity of the game. However, Lansky believes that illegal ties and schemes will always occur for multiple reasons. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups leaves the Mark O.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Independent journalist Andrew Leyden\u0027s casual bike ride through the nation\u0027s capital took an unexpected turn in July 2023 when he noticed hazmat fire trucks approaching the area around the White House. \"Something big was going on, something bigger than normal,\" Leyden said in the new Fox Nation special, \"Cocaine at 1600.\" 50 CENT PARTNERS WITH FOX NATION TO TAKE ON TRUE CRIME WITH NEW SERIES THIS SEPTEMBER The White House, seen from the park side on Oct. 25, 2024 in Washington, D.C. (Soeren Stache/picture alliance via Getty Images) The \"something bigger\" was a small baggie of white powder identified as cocaine. That baggie would become the source of speculation for some time, as the Trump administration now takes another look into the case that was shuttered during former President Joe Biden\u0027s term. That incident, and the mysteries surrounding it, are the focus of \"Cocaine at 1600.\" The show investigates who brought the substance into the White House in the first place and incorporates stories and perspectives like Leyden\u0027s to explore the incident in detail. NEWLY UNCOVERED TED BUNDY FOOTAGE EXPOSES THE MULTI-STATE EFFORT TO CAPTURE THE INFAMOUS SERIAL KILLER A photo of the baggie of cocaine discovered in the White House in July 2023. (U.S. Secret Service) A source close to the investigation has confirmed to Fox Nation that a guest in the White House found the baggie and alerted the Secret Service, who in turn called the D.C. Fire Department. \"There are hazmat incidents at the White House every week outside with backpacks, and usually the Secret Service handles that on their own,\" Leyden explained. \"They can see it\u0027s a backpack, they maybe bring their dogs up, the firemen don\u0027t even come nearby, [the hazmat teams are] not even needed.\" But when hazmat teams went into the perimeter and down West Executive, he knew something was amiss. Leyden, who usually carries a scanner with him, said the fire department would typically make hazardous material calls on an encrypted channel, meaning no one can hear them.

Despite not knowing about the discovery of cocaine in the building, Leyden described spending approximately an hour on the scene, hearing chaotic radio calls amid the chaos. \"Cocaine at 1600\" is available now on Fox Nation.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! President Donald Trump isn’t the first commander-in-chief to face scrutiny over White House renovations. Throughout its 223-year history, the iconic residence has seen numerous updates — both large and small — under nearly every administration. Many on the left have been in an uproar of late, accusing Trump of damaging White House history as construction begins on a new White House ballroom. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP COMMITTED TO ‘TRADITION’ OF WHITE HOUSE TOURS AFTER BALLROOM CONSTRUCTION President Trump’s privately funded $200 million White House ballroom is the latest \"bold, necessary addition\" to the executive residence, officials said, describing the East Wing construction as a continuation of presidential upgrades dating back more than a century. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., questioned what leverage contributors might have over Trump if they are donating to the renovation. Construction on the White House ballroom kicked off Monday and is expected to be finished \"long before\" the end of Trump\u0027s term. (The Associated Press) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also criticized the move, writing Tuesday on X, \"It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.\" Construction on the ballroom kicked off Monday, with the project \"expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump’s term,\" according to the White House. \"Nearly every single president who’s lived in this beautiful White House … has made modernizations and renovations of their own,\" said Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt this week.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) From President Bill Clinton\u0027s creation of a jogging path around the South Grounds driveway to President Dwight Eisenhower\u0027s installation of a putting green, the People’s House has continually evolved to reflect the times and the presidents who called it home. Here\u0027s a look at some of the most notable renovations that have shaped the White House through the years. Theodore Roosevelt builds West Wing (1902) President Theodore Roosevelt built the West Wing in 1902. (The White House President George W. Bush) Before it was officially known as the White House, the residence was commonly called the Executive Mansion or the President’s House. President Theodore Roosevelt is credited with making the \"White House\" official when Congress allocated funds for repairs and refurnishing, according to the National Park Service. KAROLINE LEAVITT: THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A BIG, BEAUTIFUL BALLROOM FOR GENERATIONS TO COME During this period, Roosevelt also replaced the old conservatories with new executive offices, establishing what became known as the West Wing. Work began in June 1902 and was completed by the year-end. William Howard Taft creates first Oval Office (1909) President Taft held a competition to select an architect to make Roosevelt’s temporary West Wing permanent, according to the White House Historical Association (WHAA). Washington, D.C.\u0027s Nathan C. Wyeth designed the expansion and created the Oval Office. Wyeth was inspired by the Blue Room in the White House for its oval shape, creating a \"levee.\" President Trump, above, is shown in the Oval Office.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"The levee, a tradition that evolved from the English court, was an occasion to allow men of prominence to meet the president,\" writes the WHAA.

Franklin Roosevelt adds East Wing (1942), indoor pool (1933) An indoor swimming pool was installed in 1933 following FDR’s polio diagnosis so he could swim for exercise. It was funded by a campaign. (National Archives) The East Wing was erected in 1942 during FDR’s administration to house additional staff and offices. The East Wing project was highly controversial amid World War II. \"Congressional Republicans labeled the expenditure as wasteful, with some accusing Roosevelt of using the project to bolster his presidency’s image,\" the WHAA notes on its website.

The Daily News created the \"Roosevelt Swimming Pool Fund\" for the project, raising over $12,000, according to the WHAA. The White House Press Room came into being during President Nixon\u0027s term; he converted the indoor pool to a new space for the growing media. (AP/Evan Vucci) President Richard Nixon then converted the pool into the White House Press Room in 1970 to create a space for the growing press. Nixon reportedly did not want any harm done to the structure, so the pool could be restored easily, with a project architect saying this was \"in case he received comments that he destroyed the FDR pool.\" The Gerald Ford administration installed an outdoor pool on the South Lawn in 1975.

Check out what\u0027s clicking on Foxnews.com. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it\u0027s a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren\u0027t an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let\u0027s talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.

SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS How does the university payroll scam work According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits. Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE Hackers are exploiting universities at scale The hackers don\u0027t stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam. To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods. Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don\u0027t exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs. Hackers lure staff with convincing emails that mimic campus alerts or HR updates and steal login details in real time. (Microsoft) 6 ways to stay safe from payroll and phishing scams Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn\u0027t complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information. 1) Limit what personal information is online The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u0027t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u0027s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com. Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com 2) Think before you click Scammers often send emails that look like they come from your HR department or university leadership, warning about payroll, benefits or urgent issues. Don\u0027t click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.

(Javi Sanz/Getty Images) 3) Verify directly with the source If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks. 4) Use strong, unique passwords Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don\u0027t have to remember dozens of different combinations. Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials. Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com. 5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) Add an extra layer of security by enabling 2FA on all accounts that support it. This means even if someone steals your password, they still can\u0027t log in without a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone. 6) Regularly check financial and payroll accounts Even if you follow all precautions, it\u0027s smart to monitor your accounts for any unusual activity. Catching unauthorized transactions quickly can prevent bigger losses and alert you to potential scams before they escalate.

(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Kurt\u0027s key takeaway The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing. The scale and sophistication of these attacks highlight how vulnerable even well-established institutions can be to financially motivated threat actors.

When pressed on why Democrats are using working-class Americans as \"leverage\" amid the ongoing government shutdown, several Democratic senators offered varying responses — but only one rejected the premise that their party is holding Americans hostage. \"It\u0027s the only lever we have,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., responded when asked about the matter. \"We\u0027re doing this because we\u0027re hearing from so many families concerned about their healthcare,\" said Sen.

The Republican running against New York Democratic attorney general Letitia James took aim at her relationship with socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in an interview with Fox News Digital, arguing that it puts New York voters in jeopardy. \"That association is not a surprise, because when she first ran for the New York City Council in New York City, she ran on the Working Family Party line because the Democrat party wouldn\u0027t endorse her, she\u0027s been a supporter of cashless her whole political career,\" Michael Henry told Fox News Digital about James’ endorsement and association with Mamdani.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! The partner of a dead motorcyclist in Washington state said she felt \"hopeless\" as her sweetheart\u0027s alleged killer walked out of jail after posting a $50,000 bail, which one expert says is extremely low. Dennis \"D.J.\" Thornlow was killed on July 2 as he was riding his motorcycle in Anacortes, Washington. Detectives said 49-year-old Josue Flores \"intentionally\" ran over Thornlow and dragged him with his car for more than 50 yards across a parking lot, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Flores was charged with felony hit-and-run, vehicular homicide and second-degree murder. Authorities claim Flores was following Thornlow \"too closely\" when the motorcyclist \"swerved\" into a parking lot, falling off as a result. Flores then \"intentionally\" ran over Thornlow with his car and dragged his body for 62 yards, the probable cause affidavit states. When Thornlow\u0027s body came to a resting place after falling off the motorcycle, the court document details that Flores then \"quickly\" turned right into the parking lot and angled his car directly toward Thornlow, running over his head and leg. Surveillance video reviewed by investigators allegedly shows Flores\u0027 car turn sharply toward Thornlow after he crashed the motorcycle. MURDER SUSPECT ARRESTED OVER 40 TIMES BEFORE ALLEGEDLY KILLING HOTEL GUEST Dennis \"D.J.\" Thornlow with his partner, Jordan Weeks. (Jordan Weeks) When questioned by police, Flores said it was a \"rare occurrence\" for him to leave his apartment because his neighbors were \"constantly harassing him,\" but needed to cash his social security check. Flores claimed Thornlow \"tried to hit me\" and became violent after their first interaction at an intersection. However, Flores\u0027 claim of leaving the house was contradicted by his own mother, who allegedly told police he had already cashed the check. Flores also claimed Thornlow was \"yelling racial slurs\" at him and making death threats, adding the motorcyclist was wearing a \"Nazi-type helmet.\" When asked by police why Thornlow would act so violent, Flores said he presumed it was because he\u0027s Hispanic and had a run-down car, according to the court document, adding that he claimed Thornlow kept following his car too closely. Police found no evidence corroborating Flores\u0027 claims about Thornlow. \"I was shocked. I didn\u0027t understand. I thought, did I hear him wrong?\" — Jordan Weeks, Thornlow\u0027s partner After leaving the parking lot, Flores allegedly told authorities his car began shaking and he thought he was out of gas, so he pulled over to \"figure out how to get to the Anacortes Police Department to ‘own it.’\" When police asked what he meant by wanting to \"own it,\" Flores responded: \"All I know is that he crashed.

Judge Thomas Verge set bail at $50,000 during an Aug. 19 hearing on the second-degree murder charge despite a higher request from prosecutors, records show. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital the fact a judge would set bail for second-degree murder at $50,000 is \"shocking.\" ICE SLAMS \u0027OPEN BORDER POLICIES\u0027 AFTER FOUR-TIME DEPORTEE MURDERS TACOMA AUTO DEALER Dennis \"D.J.\" Thornlow smiles with his partner, Jordan Weeks.

This is someone that should be spending the rest of his life in prison, and instead, he\u0027s out a free man.\" Records reviewed by Fox News Digital also show Flores previously served time in prison after being found guilty. In 1996, Flores was found guilty of fourth-degree assault and was sentenced to one year in jail, with 335 days of that sentence suspended. Charging documents say Flores shot a BB gun at someone riding a bike. FLORIDA SERIAL OFFENDER ACCUSED OF DRAGGING BICYCLIST TO DEATH IN HIT-AND-RUN Dennis \"D.J.\" Thornlow was allegedly run over by Josue Flores. (Jordan Weeks) In March 2022, he was charged with assaulting a health care worker. A probable cause affidavit alleges that Flores punched a health care worker in the head \"4 or 5 times\" while he was trying to administer medicine. According to the affidavit, Flores admitted to hitting the individual in the head because \"[the worker] makes me nervous.\" That case was dismissed, documents show. A neighbor told detectives in summer 2025 that one time, when talking with Flores about a family member in jail, he said: \"if someone f----- with me, they wouldn’t live to tell about it.\" Other neighbors at his old apartment complex told detectives that Flores would \"often speak about his past gang involvement with SUR13,\" the court document shows. Jordan Weeks, Thornlow\u0027s partner, told Fox News Digital she felt \"hopeless\" when she heard Verge rule that Flores\u0027 bail was only set at $50,000. \"I was shocked. I didn\u0027t understand. I thought, did I hear him wrong?\" Weeks said. \"I think I was trying to have faith and I still do have faith, but that was a big crack.\" Weeks said that she\u0027s known Thornlow for six years, adding that he has always treated people with respect and said Flores\u0027 accusations don\u0027t add up. \"He was friends with everybody. You know, it doesn\u0027t matter what you looked like or what background you had or, you know, if you, it didn\u0027t matter the type of person you were. He always met you with kindness and respect. And it just doesn\u0027t sound, it sounds unfounded to me. It doesn\u0027t sound like the DJ that I know. And I know him very well,\" Weeks said of Flores\u0027 accusations.

(Jordan Weeks) She said that Thornlow had a 13-year-old daughter whom he had a \"very beautiful relationship\" with. \"He loved me enough to see that I was going through something, working towards my career and having a very stressful year. So he tried to make sure that in other areas he could support me,\" Weeks said. \"I could tell even before I met his daughter, how much he loved and cared about her. Being a father is one of the most important things to him.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Flores\u0027 attorney and a representative of Verge for comment.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Renovations in large public buildings are not exactly unusual. Even at the White House, renovations are common. But the national media despise President Donald Trump so deeply that they’ll turn anything he does into a scandal. This week, it’s building a new ballroom at The White House with private donations. The president originally said the East Wing would remain intact, but it came down this week, which led to an outpouring of angst. First came the \"optics\" of this. CBS reporter Weijia Jiang relayed, \"Some Democrats have criticized President Trump for focusing on a new ballroom while the government remains shut down.\" That’s shameless, since it’s the Democrats who refuse to end the shutdown. ABC’s Mary Bruce, who routinely cheer-led President Joe Biden’s time at the White House, also brought the \"growing controversy\" chatter and found Republicans for the optics argument: \"Some Republicans tonight [are] now questioning the optics of this, especially during the shutdown.\" She located just one: outgoing North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. Then Bruce added, \"former First Lady Hillary Clinton saying to the American people, ‘it\u0027s not his house, it\u0027s your house and he\u0027s destroying it.’\" Her daughter Chelsea Clinton penned an op-ed for USA Today with the same \"people’s house\" theme. FETTERMAN DEFENDS TRUMP\u0027S \u0027TASTEFUL\u0027 $200M WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM MAKEOVER AMID DEM CRITICISM This is rich, considering the Clintons sold overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom to top donors and President Bill Clinton turned the White House into an intern sex den. It’s also rich considering the Clintons were caught trying to steal $28,000 worth of donated furniture as they vacated the house in 2001. Guess what? The Washington Post broke the story, but the broadcast networks didn’t want to repeat it. Imagine the Reagans trying to make off with donated furniture? Imperious Nancy never would have heard the end of it. But the Clintons were let off the hook. ABC reported nothing on air. On CBS, Dan Rather gave it 19 seconds. NBC offered a full story in the evening after the Post, but by the next morning, \"Today\" co-host Matt Lauer was calling the whole thing off: \"Is this a big deal, or are we in the middle of Pick On The Clintons Month?\" Newsweek’s Howard Fineman helpfully replied, \"Well, it’s always Pick On The Clintons Month.\" Anyone who watches these Clinton-coddling networks and their incessantly hyper-negative coverage of the Trumps can only roll their eyes. DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP\u0027S BALLROOM IS NO VANITY PROJECT, IT\u0027S ABOUT AMERICAN GRANDEUR Even on the ballroom story, NBC trotted out Connecticut Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal to throw the tyranny card: \"It\u0027s his personal whim and it is sort of emblematic of the authoritarian, tyrannical approach that this president takes to power.\" The White House said President Donald Trump would directly reveal a name for the upcoming White House ballroom. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images) It’s privately funded, so it needs no congressional approval. The liberals can’t stop it from happening. So, somehow, it’s a power grab to build a grand new ballroom for future presidents to enjoy. At least NBC News shows had to disclose that their owner Comcast is a donor to the renovation, which will be for all future presidents. Unsurprisingly, the unanimous Trump-haters at ABC’s \"The View\" offered nothing but cauldrons of spite. Sunny Hostin couldn’t stop calling the ballroom plans \"tacky and gaudy,\" and Whoopi Goldberg falsely said, \"your taxes are probably going to be paying for that ballroom.\" Joy Behar said this demolition proved Trump was a \"one-man wrecking ball\" and bungled into calling him an \"annihilist.\" He \"annihilates.\" They really hated Trump asking for millions of dollars of reimbursement from the Justice Department over all the investigations of him, leading Hostin to uncork the conspiracy that he was never leaving the White House: \"If he gets this $230 million, it’s going to be used to renovate a White House which he never intends to leave!\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The late-night comedians performed their usual leftist rituals. Outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert cracked: \"As of this morning, the East Wing looks like a rotisserie chicken your dog got into.\" He called it a \"ball-doggle\" funded by \"groveling corporations like Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Google, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Meta Platforms and Hard Rock International.\" Video Previous renovations under Democrats were not controversial. On September 10, 2010, CNN aired a cheery story from anchor Suzanne Malveaux about all \"the banging, the jack-hammering, the dust\" from a taxpayer-funded $375 million renovation. They said Congress approved funding in 2008, and no one went looking for politicians to cry \"authoritarian.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Back in 1962, CBS and NBC aired a prime-time special promoting First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy offering a tour of the White House under renovation. ABC ran it four days later. They were all engaged in \"Camelot\" myth-making, creating \"cultural icon\" Jackie while JFK was besmirching the White House with extramarital affairs. If the White House is \"the people\u0027s house,\" then why would the people object to a glamorous ballroom that can accommodate large gatherings, especially important foreign dignitaries? It\u0027s only an outrage because it\u0027s Trump\u0027s project.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! In his Oct. 13 address to Israel\u0027s Knesset in Jerusalem, President Donald Trump upset Israeli leftists when he called for Israel\u0027s largely ceremonial President Isaac Herzog to use his one actual power — the power of pardon — and pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has been on trial for more than five years on absurd charges regarding cigars and champagne he received over 20 years ago from old friends. Those charges fell apart in the opening months of the trial as one prosecution witness after another exposed the emptiness of Israel\u0027s Netanyahu-hating prosecutors\u0027 indictments against the country\u0027s longest-serving and most successful leader. All the same, the Netanyahu-hating judge presiding over the trial is now requiring Netanyahu to appear in court three days a week for a total of 24 hours a week to testify. U.S. President Donald Trump greets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he arrives at the White House for a meeting on April 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Chen Mengtong/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) Leftists in Israel dominate the country\u0027s media and legal fraternity, much as they do in America. And they were incensed that President Trump dared to interfere in Israel\u0027s \"internal affairs.\" One anchorman referred to Trump\u0027s call for a pardon as \"disgusting, and revolting.\" But the truth is that by asking Israel\u0027s left-leaning president to put an end to Israel\u0027s Deep State\u0027s assault on Netanyahu, Trump was defending America\u0027s national interests. \u0027VIEW\u0027 CO-HOST PRAISES FORMER BOSS TRUMP FOR \u0027MASSIVE DIPLOMATIC ACHIEVEMENT\u0027 IN HOSTAGE DEAL This is true for two reasons. First, the corrupt legal authorities involved in the trial are abusing their power over Netanyahu in a way that undermines American interests. On Wednesday, just two days after President Trump gave his address, Netanyahu was back in the courtroom in Tel Aviv. He had asked the judges to let him delay his testimony so that he could hold certain meetings. The judges and prosecutors demanded to know what meetings could possibly justify delaying his testimony. He explained one was highly classified, and they demanded to know what it was about. Within hours of the exchange, the story leaked that Netanyahu was scheduled to meet secretly with the president of Indonesia. The leader of the largest Muslim state in the world, President Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to pay a top-secret trip to Jerusalem as a step toward opening diplomatic relations with Israel. This was to be one of the most important fruits of Israel\u0027s U.S.-supported victory in its seven-front war against Iran and its axis of terror. But thanks to Israel\u0027s corrupt legal fraternity, the meeting leaked to their press allies, and President Subianto stayed away. President Trump made clear in his speech that expanding the circle of peace between Israel and the Islamic world is a chief U.S. goal. Israel is America\u0027s most powerful ally in the troubled Middle East. Trump sees it as an essential U.S. interest that the Arab and Islamic world accept Israel as a permanent entity and an allied state. But for Israel\u0027s politicized Deep State, undermining and humiliating Netanyahu by chaining him to a courtroom and subverting his diplomatic actions is apparently more important. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to the audience at a conference in Jerusalem, Sunday, July 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg) These radical jurists must be stopped, not only for Netanyahu to be able to devote himself entirely to serving his country — they need to be stopped to enable President Trump to secure America\u0027s goals in the Middle East. WITH HOSTAGES FREED, TRUMP THANKS OTHERS IN ISRAEL SPEECH BUT IS TOO QUICK TO DECLARE WAR IS OVER The second reason that ending this farce of justice against Netanyahu is in the United States’ interests is that there is a link between the forces of political warfare and lawfare in Israel and the U.S. If you scratch just beneath the surface, you\u0027ll doubtlessly find that for the same billionaire agents of anarchy, who funded and brought the unprecedented lawfare against both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, working to undo Israel as a key way to unravel American society. For example, the Tides Foundation funds radical groups, including pro-Hamas protesters in America, and it funds groups involved in the protests and riots and political violence in Israel. Tides is one of several foundations whose actions in the U.S. and Israel are the subject of multiple congressional investigations. One of the investigations focuses on well-documented claims that the billion-dollar, multi-year effort to criminalize Netanyahu that engulfed Israel in political instability for years, was funded in part by the Biden administration. That investigation must continue and the U.S. government officials who funded and facilitated political chaos in Israel should be forced to account for their actions.

( Lev Radin/Sipa USA (Sipa via AP Images)) Even more importantly, the IRS should investigate how U.S. non-profits groups that enjoy U.S. tax exemption valued at millions of dollars have abused their status to fund political violence, insurrection, and mayhem in Israel. In some cases, according to Hamas\u0027s own internal documents, these U.S.-based non-profit-funded groups\u0027 campaigns convinced the genocidal terror group that Israel was ripe for annihilation on October 7, 2023. TRUMP CALLS FOR NETANYAHU PARDON AFTER HAILING SWIFT REMOVAL OF LEFT-WING LAWMAKERS BY SECURITY In his historic speech in Jerusalem, President Trump laid out great plans for building a new Middle East that will join Israel\u0027s genius and power to the oil-wealth of its neighbors and transform the Middle East into a driver of global prosperity under American leadership. Trump would have been hard-pressed to lead this momentous undertaking if the Deep State were still persecuting him, his top aides and his children. Netanyahu has miraculously been able to lead Israel to one of the most important military victories in its history. With Trump\u0027s assistance, Israel destroyed Iran\u0027s axis of terror across seven fronts. Netanyahu achieved this while forced to spend days on end in a courtroom answering asinine questions from shameless prosecutors before brazen judges. Imagine what Netanyahu and President Trump would be able to do together if Netanyahu doesn\u0027t have to spend 24 hours per week in a courtroom.

And he would be right to order the IRS to start investigating the role American non-profits have played and continue to play in destabilizing Israel and corrupting its legal system. Israel\u0027s leftists, like their American funders, may not like President Trump for doing it, but generations of Americans, Israelis, and peoples of the wider Middle East will thank him.

The administration at Rutgers University is doubling down on its push for the school’s Turning Point USA chapter to hold elections that would replace officers who spoke out against Antifa-aligned professor Mark Bray, according to emails obtained by Fox News Digital. In a Thursday email, Neela Patel, executive director for student centers and activities at Rutgers, directed the TPUSA chapter to hold elections to replace its treasurer, Megyn Doyle, the student who started the petition to remove Bray, as well as the vice president, who recently stepped down. \"I am following up on the email below, which I sent on October 17, 2025, about the officer follow-up for Turning Point USA–Rutgers,\" Patel wrote. \"As of today, I have not received a response to discuss the necessary next steps. Therefore, I am requesting that the organization proceed with holding elections to fill the Vice President and Treasurer positions, in accordance with University policies and the organization’s constitution.\" Patel added that elections must be completed by Nov. 19 and that all candidates must meet specific eligibility requirements.

First-semester students are not eligible to hold officer positions.\" The email follows earlier correspondence obtained by Fox News Digital from Karima Woodyard, Rutgers’ director for student involvement and leadership, who told the TPUSA chapter that both Doyle and Ava Kwan, the chapter’s outreach coordinator, should be removed from their positions. Woodyard argued that neither student was eligible to serve in executive roles because Doyle is enrolled at the Rutgers Newark campus and Kwan is a graduate student.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Analysts say China has developed a chilling strategy for fighting a war with the United States: destroy America’s fighter jets before they ever leave the ground. In nearly every modern conflict, disabling enemy aircraft on the ground has been the first move. When Israel struck Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year, it began by destroying Iranian runways — grounding Tehran’s air force before it could take off. Russia and Ukraine have done the same throughout their ongoing war, targeting airfields to cripple enemy aircraft. And when India clashed with Pakistan, the opening salvos hit Pakistani air bases. Beijing has taken that lesson to heart. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has spent years building an arsenal of long-range precision missiles — including \"carrier killers\" like the DF-21D and DF-26 — capable of destroying U.S. aircraft carriers and striking American airfields across the Pacific. The goal: keep U.S. air power out of range before it can even launch. ISRAEL TO DEPLOY FIRST COMBAT-READY LASER WEAPON SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONAL AIR DEFENSE Shield AI unveils its X-BAT AI fighter jet. Now, a U.S. defense technology firm says it has built a way to fight back. Shield AI, based in San Diego, has unveiled a new AI-piloted fighter jet designed to operate without runways, without GPS, and without constant communication links — an aircraft that can think, fly, and fight on its own. Shield AI says the jet, called X-BAT, can take off vertically, reach 50,000 feet, fly more than 2,000 nautical miles, and execute strike or air defense missions using an onboard autonomy system known as Hivemind. It’s designed to operate from ships, small islands, or improvised sites — places where traditional jets can’t. The aircraft’s dash speed remains classified. \"China has built this anti-access aerial denial bubble that holds our runways at risk,\" said Armor Harris, Shield AI’s senior vice president of aircraft engineering, in an interview with Fox News. \"They’ve basically said, ‘We’re not going to compete stealth-on-stealth in the air — we’ll target your aircraft before they even get off the ground.’\" The jet launches vertically, and three X-BATs can fit in the space of one legacy fighter or helicopter. According to Harris, the U.S. has spent decades perfecting stealth and survivability in the air while leaving its forces vulnerable on the ground. \"The way to solve that problem is mobility,\" he said. \"You’re always moving around. This is the only VTOL fighter being built today.\" Video X-BAT’s Hivemind autonomy allows it to operate in denied or jammed environments, where traditional aircraft would be blind. The system uses onboard sensors to interpret its surroundings, reroute around threats, and identify targets in real time. \"It’s reading and reacting to the situation around it,\" Harris said. \"It’s not flying a pre-programmed route. If new threats appear, it can reroute itself or identify targets and then ask a human for permission to engage.\" That human element, he emphasized, remains essential. \"It’s very important to us that a human is always involved in making the use of lethal force decision,\" Harris said. \"That doesn’t mean the person has to be in the cockpit — it could be remote or delegated through tasking — but there will always be a human decision-maker.\" 3 X-BAT fighter jets can fit in the space of one traditional fighter jet or helicopter, according to the company. (Shield AI ) Shield AI says X-BAT will be combat-ready by 2029 and is designed to deliver fifth- or sixth-generation performance at a small fraction of the cost of manned fighters. The aircraft’s compact footprint allows up to three X-BATs to fit in the deck space of a single legacy fighter or helicopter, giving commanders more flexibility in launching sorties from limited space. AMERICA’S NEW STEALTH B-21 RAIDER TAKES NEXT STEP WITH SECOND BOMBER’S FIRST FLIGHT The AI fighter jet is designed to be able to vertically take off from sea, mobile or tight ground space. (Shield AI ) While Shield AI isn’t disclosing specific numbers, the company says X-BAT is priced in the same range as the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the next generation of autonomous wingmen meant to fly alongside — and eventually ahead of — manned fighters. Costs vary depending on mission systems and configurations, but the company’s goal is to scale production to keep the jet affordable and sustainable throughout its lifecycle, breaking what it calls the traditional \"fighter cost curve.\" The company estimates the aircraft will deliver about a tenfold improvement in cost per effect compared to legacy fifth-generation jets, including the F-35, while remaining \"affordable and attritable\" enough to be risked in high-end combat. Designed with a potential Indo-Pacific conflict in mind, which would require maneuverability on small island chains. (Shield AI ) Shield AI is in discussions with both the Air Force and Navy about integrating X-BAT into future combat programs and with several allied militaries exploring joint development opportunities. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Harris said the company views X-BAT as part of a generational shift toward distributed airpower — one that mirrors what SpaceX did in space. \"Historically, the United States had a small number of extremely capable, extremely expensive satellites,\" he said. \"Then you had SpaceX come along and put up hundreds of smaller, cheaper ones. The same thing is happening in air power. There’s always going to be a role for manned platforms, but over time, unmanned systems will outnumber them ten-to-one or twenty-to-one.\" For Harris, that shift is about restoring deterrence through flexibility. \"X-BAT presents an asymmetric dilemma to an adversary like China,\" he said. \"They don’t know where it’s coming from, and the cost of countering it is high. It’s an important part of a broader joint force that becomes significantly more lethal.

The Trump administration urged a federal judge during a hearing in Oregon on Friday to terminate a restraining order and clear the way for the government to deploy National Guard troops in Portland. The administration argued to Judge Karin Immergut that a higher court had already greenlit President Donald Trump’s use of the National Guard there. Immergut, a Trump appointee, said she would decide by Monday whether to toss out her order. \"[I’ll be] working as fast as I can to get a decision that honors the 9th Circuit decision but also takes into account some of the new arguments and new information that’s been provided,\" Immergut said.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images) The Trump administration has remained blocked from deploying the reserved troops to support the president’s law enforcement crackdown in Portland, a liberal haven that Trump claims is rife with illegal immigrants, street crime and threats to federal law enforcement. \"I looked at Portland over the weekend, the place is burning down, just burning down,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office this week. Immergut’s hearing was only the latest in a string of clashes between local Democratic leaders and the president over their division of law enforcement powers. The president has claimed he is authorized to deploy National Guard troops in cities to support federal immigration enforcement officers, while several blue states and cities claim Trump is wildly mischaracterizing the level of crime and unrest and that military reinforcements are unwarranted and encroach on their sovereignty. WHITE HOUSE REBUKES ‘EGREGIOUS’ COURT ORDER BLOCKING TROOP DEPLOYMENTS AMID PORTLAND UNREST U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an executive order signing in the Oval Office at the White House on Feb. 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) A lawyer arguing on behalf of Oregon told Immergut on Friday that Trump\u0027s attempt to deploy 200 National Guard soldiers from other states into Portland had \"no justification whatsoever.\" The lawyer called it a \"grossly disproportionate response to the situation.\" The court saga in Oregon began when Immergut issued two back-to-back restraining orders blocking Trump from deploying California National Guard soldiers to Portland and blocking Trump from deploying any National Guard soldiers to Portland, respectively. The government appealed the first order, and a 9th Circuit panel decided this week in a 2-1 decision to side with Trump in that matter. But a full bench of judges might now reconsider that decision, and Immergut\u0027s second order also remains intact, meaning Trump currently cannot deploy the National Guard to Oregon. A Department of Justice lawyer said the 9th Circuit panel\u0027s decision halting Immergut\u0027s first order means both of her orders should \"rise and fall together.\" \"I just don’t know that there’s any way around that,\" the lawyer said.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images) The 9th Circuit panel had found that Trump was likely to succeed in his case as it proceeds through the courts and also accused Immergut of discounting months of violence and disruptions in Portland over the summer. Regardless of what Immergut does with her remaining active restraining order, the court fights are far from over as the existing orders from the courts have all been on an emergency basis.

Cynthia Sullivan, 73, died Thursday, according to a Facebook post shared Friday by a family member, and after succumbing to injuries she suffered in the incident, Boston 25 News reported. The family’s dog, who alerted Cynthia Sullivan and her husband Patrick, 72, and their 37-year-old son, Tyler, to the fire as they slept aboard their 30-foot powerboat The Third Wave, also died in the blaze. The Sullivans swam to Naushon Island — a small island roughly four miles from Martha’s Vineyard — after they awoke to heavy fire. Burned and injured, the trio took shelter inside a barn on the island, where they spent more than 24 hours until their marine radio washed ashore Wednesday morning, enabling Tyler to call for help.

A family member had reported the Sullivans missing when they didn’t arrive home Tuesday and calls to their cellphones, which went down with the boat, went straight to voicemail. Multiple agencies searched the area Tuesday night and early Wednesday, and were unable to get accurate pings from the family\u0027s submerged phones until Tyler reached them on the recovered handheld radio, according to the Coast Guard.

John Sununu, running to flip swing state Senate seat, says he wants to work with Trump ‘to get things done’ Republican John E. Sununu of New Hampshire, a former senator running in the 2026 elections to win back his job, speaks with Fox News Digital about his campaign to flip a blue seat in a swing state. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! EXCLUSIVE: RYE, N.H. — It\u0027s been 15 years since Republicans won a U.S. Senate election in swing state New Hampshire. But former Sen. John E. Sununu is confident he can break his party\u0027s losing streak. \"This is a race I know I can win,\" Sununu told Fox News Digital last month. Sununu launched his 2026 GOP Senate campaign earlier this week, and on Friday explained why he\u0027s the right person to flip the seat currently held by longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who\u0027s retiring after next year. FIRST ON FOX: FORMER GOP SENATOR EMERGES FROM PRIVATE SECTOR WITH NEW MISSION -\u0027SOMEBODY HAS TO STEP UP\u0027 Former Republican Sen. John E. Sununu of New Hampshire, who is running in 2026 to return to the Senate, is interviewed by Fox News Digital in Rye, N.H., on Oct. 24, 2025. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News) \"It\u0027s the right message, the right set of issues, and also the right person,\" Sununu told Fox News Digital, in his first national interview after declaring his candidacy. Sununu is a former three-term representative who defeated then-Gov. Shaheen in New Hampshire\u0027s 2002 Senate election. But the senator lost to Shaheen in their 2008 rematch. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE 2025 ELECTIONS Shaheen announced earlier this year that she wouldn\u0027t seek re-election in next year\u0027s midterms and Republicans are working to flip the seat as they aim to not only defend but expand their 53-47 Senate majority. Now, after nearly two decades in the private sector, Sununu is returning to the campaign trail in New England\u0027s only swing state. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., seen speaking at a policy event in Concord, New Hampshire on Oct. 22, 2024, is not seeking re-election next year. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) Sununu, in his launch video, said that nowadays \"Congress just seems loud, dysfunctional, even angry,\" and that he wants to \"return to the Senate to help calm the waters.\" Asked if that\u0027s the kind of message that the Republican base wants to hear, the former senator said: \"They want to win. I think they want to have someone who advocates for New Hampshire and gets things done. Someone like me, who can walk into the Oval Office and work to keep taxes low for New Hampshire, work with the administration, work with President Trump.\" FORMER REPUBLICAN SENATOR ON POTENTIAL BID TO FLIP SWING STATE SEAT RED: \u0027THIS IS A RACE I KNOW I CAN WIN\u0027 Sununu\u0027s said his \"priorities are, affordability, keep taxes low, give our state just a strong, clear voice in Washington,\" and that he\u0027s \"carrying that message across the state, meeting with activists, meeting with businesses, talking to them about their needs.\" \"There are three things I\u0027ve spent my life doing: standing up for New Hampshire, solving tough problems and working with people to get things done for New Hampshire. That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027ll do as senator,\" he said. Sununu is a brand name in New Hampshire politics. The former senator\u0027s father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor who later served as chief of staff in then-President George H.W. Bush\u0027s White House. And one of his younger brothers is former Gov. Chris Sununu, who won election and re-election to four two-year terms steering the Granite State. But Sununu won\u0027t have a glide path to the GOP nomination. Former Sen. Scott Brown, who launched a Republican Senate campaign in New Hampshire in June, is interviewed by Fox News Digital, on July 4, 2025, in Exeter, N.H. (Paul Steinhauser - Fox News ) Former ambassador and former Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected and served three years in the Senate in neighboring Massachusetts, and who, as the 2014 GOP Senate nominee in New Hampshire, narrowly lost to Shaheen during her first re-election, jumped into the race in late June. \"Our campaign will have the necessary resources for the long haul, and allow me to campaign the only way I know how: relentless hard work and a focus on retail politics that Granite State voters expect,\" Brown said after Fox News first reported a couple of weeks ago that he hauled in roughly $1.2 million in fundraising the past three months. SCOOP: FORMER TRUMP AMBASSADOR SHOWCASES MAJOR FUNDRAISING HAUL IN BATTLE TO FLIP DEM SENATE SEAT Brown has repeatedly taken aim at Sununu the past month over the former senator\u0027s lack of past support for Trump, who holds immense clout over the GOP. Sununu served as national co-chair on the 2016 Republican presidential campaign of then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who declined to support Trump as the party\u0027s nominee. And Sununu, along with then-Gov. Chris Sununu, endorsed former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the 2024 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary, as she battled Trump for the nomination. Former Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) And on the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, the former senator wrote an opinion piece titled, \"Donald Trump is a loser,\" that ran in the New Hampshire Union Leader, the state\u0027s largest daily newspaper. Brown endorsed Trump ahead of his 2016 New Hampshire primary victory, which launched him toward the GOP presidential nomination and ultimately the White House. Brown later served as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand during Trump\u0027s first term. \"Anyone who thinks that a never Trump, corporate lobbyist who hasn’t won an election in a quarter century, will resonate with today’s GOP primary voters is living in a different universe. While John was supporting John Kasich in 2016, I was campaigning with Donald Trump,\" Brown charged in a statement to Fox News Digital. Asked about the criticism, Sununu said: \"This race is about who is going to do the best job for New Hampshire, and I absolutely can work with the Trump administration on issues important to New Hampshire.\" Brown, pointing to Sununu\u0027s past decade and a half in the private sector, argued that \"while John was fighting for special interests, I was serving in the first Trump administration.\" And the New Hampshire Democratic Party also blasted the former senator over his private sector tenure. \"John Sununu went to Washington almost 30 years ago, then cashed in, making millions selling out to corporations and working for Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Wall Street while the people of New Hampshire paid the price,\" longtime state party chair Ray Buckley argued in a statement. \"The only reason Sununu wants to go back to Washington now is to sell out New Hampshire to the same corporations and special interests that have lined his pockets for years. Granite Staters won’t let him sell us out again.\" Sununu, pushing back, said: \"I have never lobbied any member of Congress on any issue for any business. My work has been in technology in the private sector.\" \"We need that background of business and private sector experience in Washington. We don\u0027t want a bunch of lawyers making all the decisions in Washington,\" Sununu added, in a jab at Brown, an attorney who served as dean of New England Law Boston after returning to the U.S. at the end of the Trump administration. Trump, whose endorsement in Republican primaries is extremely influential, has remained neutral to date. President Donald Trump, seen celebrating in Nashua, New Hampshire on Jan. 23, 2024 after winning the state\u0027s first-in-the-nation presidential primary, remains neutral to date in the 2026 Senate primary in the Granite State. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo) But the president may be willing to overlook Sununu\u0027s past jabs. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Trump ally and chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, announced hours after Sununu\u0027s launch that the Senate GOP\u0027s campaign arm would back the former senator\u0027s bid. And the Senate Leadership Fund, the top super PAC supporting Senate Republicans — which is aligned with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and steered by Trump world veterans — praised Sununu. Sununu told Fox News Digital he \"would certainly like to have his [Trump\u0027s] endorsement, and it would be, I think, helpful in the primary.\" \"But the more support and endorsements you can have, the stronger your overall campaign is going to be,\" he added as he listed a number of top New Hampshire Republicans who are now backing him, including Steve Stepanek, a longtime top Trump Granite State ally who chaired the president\u0027s 2016 campaign in New Hampshire and served as senior adviser on last year\u0027s campaign. \"They\u0027ve all sort of joined this effort because they know I will be the best and most effective senator for the state of New Hampshire,\" he touted.

Massie has stood up to Trump and bucked his party on other issues, including by voting against the president\u0027s spending bill over the summer and affirming that Trump needs congressional approval for a war declaration. Paul, who has also stood up to Trump, voted against the bill in the Senate and has criticized the administration for moving forward with military strikes without authorization from lawmakers.

I’m tired of [being] the only one that has any guts to stand up and tell the president the truth.\" Paul has also been met with Trump\u0027s ire in recent months, but continues to hold his ground. Most recently, he has criticized the administration\u0027s military strikes on boats it accuses, without evidence, of carrying narco-terrorists.

In her posthumous memoir, Virginia Giuffre recounts being groomed as a teenager and sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell — writing that the abuse included rape by an unnamed prime minister and encounters with powerful men such as former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. The book, \"Nobody\u0027s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\" was released Tuesday and garnered global attention. While it made no explicit allegations against Clinton or Trump, Giuffre did chronicle meetings with both in contexts not related to Epstein\u0027s alleged crimes. The story Giuffre recounts of how she was sucked into Epstein and Maxwell\u0027s high-powered orbit begins when her father helped get her a job at Mar-a-Lago, where he worked as a maintenance worker. Giuffrie\u0027s discussions of Trump in the book largely place him as a background figure during her early days at Mar-a-Lago, where she eventually met Maxwell in the summer of 2000. VIRGINIA GIUFFRE’S MEMOIR REVEALS HOW EPSTEIN, MAXWELL ‘BROKE DOWN’ GIRLS STEP BY STEP IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, had her memoir released posthumously. (Cassie Basford) \"It couldn’t have been more than a few days before my dad said he wanted to introduce me to Mr. Trump himself. They weren’t friends, exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that—I’d seen photos of them posing together, shaking hands,\" Giuffre writes. \"Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. \u0027Do you like kids?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Do you babysit at all?\u0027 He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children that needed tending.\" Giuffre also recounts how Epstein and Trump\u0027s relationship eventually broke down, an explanation for which differs from the one Trump has publicly provided. Giuffre said Trump withdrew Epstein\u0027s membership at Mar-a-Lago after hitting the teenage daughter of another guest, but Trump has publicly said that a spat about Epstein coaxing his Mar-a-Lago spa employees was what led to the end of their relationship. Giuffre, working an entry-level position at the resort\u0027s spa, recounted how Maxwell sought to hire her as a masseuse despite her lack of experience. Before she knew it, Giuffre was traveling alongside Epstein and Maxwell around the world performing sexual favors. According to Giuffre, it was difficult to reconcile the fact that her abusers commanded so much respect from such powerful figures. \"This was a man who displayed framed photographs of himself with the Dalai Lama, with the pope, and with members of the British royal family. A photo in his Palm Beach house showed Epstein posing behind the podium of the White House briefing room,\" Giuffre writes. \"This was a man who’d had former president Bill Clinton over for dinner (I was at the table that night) and who’d hosted Al and Tipper Gore as well (again, I was there).\" PRINCE ANDREW VIEWED SEX WITH TEENAGE VIRGINIA GIUFFRE AS HIS \u0027BIRTHRIGHT\u0027, NEW MEMOIR CLAIMS \"Maxwell was proud of her friendships with famous people, especially men,\" Giuffre added in the memoir. \"[Maxwell] loved to talk about how easily she could get former president Bill Clinton on the phone.\" According to Giuffre, Epstein and Maxwell visited the White House together during Clinton\u0027s tenure in the Oval Office. In the book, Giuffre also recalled how Clinton flew on Epstein\u0027s plane in 2002, but she was not present for that trip. Bill Clinton was among the high-powered people in disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s orbit, according to a new memoir released by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. (Photos by: Alex Kent and Rick Friedman/Getty Images) \"On September 21, Epstein and Maxwell were leaving New York on an extended trip to Africa. Marcinkova was flying with them on Epstein\u0027s Boeing 727, as were several high-profile guests: the actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey and former president Clinton, not to mention six U.S. Secret Service agents. (Clinton has said the trip was a humanitarian mission that included stops related to the work of his foundation.)\" Giuffre wrote. However, despite naming Clinton in the book about her experience being sex trafficked by Epstein, Giuffre lamented the media\u0027s propensity to connect the former president to Epstein\u0027s crimes. \"Right away, the article noted that I had never been ‘lent out’ to the former president. But I guess the Mail found it newsworthy simply that I’d witnessed Epstein and Clinton together,\" she writes. Among the various trafficking incidents Giuffre talked about in her book, which do directly involve powerful people from Epstein and Maxwell\u0027s orbit, was a brutal rape by an unnamed former prime minister on Epstein\u0027s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2002. According to Giuffre\u0027s account of the incident, she was ordered by Epstein to have sex with the prime minister, who choked her nearly to unconsciousness and mocked her fear of the situation. Giuffre said that upon returning to Epstein after the incident, she begged not to be sent back to the prime minister, but Epstein told her the brutality was just part of the job. According to Giuffre, this horrific incident was a turning point for her.

(Emily Michot/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) \"Before the Prime Minister’s attack, Epstein had me fooled. I thought that Epstein’s predilection for childlike girls was a sickness, but that, in his twisted way, he meant well. After the attack, I couldn’t stay a fool. Having been treated so brutally and then seeing Epstein’s callous reaction to how terrorized I felt, I had to accept that Epstein meted out praise merely as a manipulation to keep me subservient. Epstein cared only about Epstein,\" Giuffre writes in her memoir. \"At that point, I hit bottom. I now knew I wouldn’t survive. I saw only two possible options: either someone Epstein trafficked me to would kill me or I would take my own life.\" Giuffre would eventually die by suicide in April, roughly six months before the release of her memoir.

California officials are giving Planned Parenthood $140 million to keep 109 clinics open and offset the financial strain from cuts imposed by Republicans in Washington, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom announced. Newsom said the move affirms the state’s continued commitment to abortion access for women in the Golden State amid efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to shut down Planned Parenthood. \"California is a reproductive freedom state, and this latest investment continues to show our belief in protecting access to essential health care in times of distress,\" Newsom said in a statement on Thursday. \"Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers.\" State lawmakers will also address the issue when the legislature reconvenes in January.

(AP/Mark Schiefelbein) Planned Parenthood had announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties starting in December. Five other clinics in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, also shuttered in recent months over federal efforts to defund the organization. Dr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, told CalMatters the federal actions are \"destroying our primary care program.\" \"It’s inhumane to take away people’s health care,\" Jacobson said. \"Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.\" Planned Parenthood needs about $27 million a month to operate all its local facilities, Jodi Hicks, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, told CalMatters. \"The Planned Parenthood affiliates in California are grateful to Governor Newsom and our allies in the Legislature for taking this necessary step to keep Planned Parenthood health centers open and able to provide critical services as they weather the impacts of the federal defund,\" Hicks said in a statement. California is the fourth state to allocate public funds to support Planned Parenthood, joining Washington, Colorado and New Mexico. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering giving public money to the organization. DEMOCRATS ESCALATE ANTI-TRUMP LAWFARE BY TARGETING CONGRESS IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING FIGHT California is the fourth state to allocate public funds to support Planned Parenthood. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson) Republicans in the nation\u0027s capital and across the country have targeted Planned Parenthood over abortion services. Trump\u0027s spending bill signed over the summer prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money for its services, including abortions, mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing. Facilities in GOP-led states with abortion restrictions have also been forced to cease the procedures following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade and returned the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states. Planned Parenthood facilities have been shuttering in various states across the country, including California and New York. Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which operates 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada — shuttered five health centers in July after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood’s funding. Mar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization is working on ways to maintain its financial stability. Adams said the closures helped keep services at the organization’s other clinics until the end of the year but that it could be met with a \"financial cliff\" in the new year.

(REUTERS/Gaelen Morse) \"We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,\" Adams told CalMatters. \"What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.\" The organization has claimed that abortions make up only 3% of its services, but pro-life groups contend that the clinics\u0027 closures in states with abortion bans prove that to be false.

So that\u0027s hardly believable anymore in 2025,\" 40 Days for Life CEO and founder Shawn Carney told Fox News Digital in August. Newsom, California lawmakers and Planned Parenthood have spent much of the year searching for a solution to keep the organization afloat without federal dollars, according to CalMatters.

During his interview with \"Triggernometry\" hosts Francis Foster and Konstantin Kisin, the three commentators noted the benefits of inner peace and moral certainty religion provides. After Kisin noted that he started going to church services again and genuinely enjoys it, Rogan agreed. \"I do too.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Virginia attorney general candidate Jay Jones faced new political fallout Friday after a report revealed his wife had donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a controversial bail organization that used millions to spring violent offenders, including accused rapists and murderers, from jail. In May 2020, during unrest in Minneapolis after George Floyd’s death, Mavis Jones posted on Twitter: \"I just donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund,\" linking to the group’s donation page and urging others to do the same. The account has since gone private. The revelation, first reported by The Washington Free Beacon, comes as Jones, a Democrat, trails Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in a tightening race for Virginia’s top law enforcement post. The state’s attorney general oversees state-level prosecutions and police oversight. JAY JONES TEXT SCANDAL SPARKS DONATION SURGE AS GOP GROUP POURS MILLIONS MORE INTO VA RACE The Minnesota Freedom Fund, promoted at the time by several progressive figures, including Sen. Kamala Harris, raised more than $41 million during the 2020 protests, pledging to support demonstrators arrested during clashes with police. But a FOX 9 investigation later found the group spent most of its money bailing out defendants accused of serious violent crimes rather than low-level protest offenses.

(Trevor Metcalfe/The Virginian-Pilot/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Among those bailed out was Christopher Boswell, a twice-convicted rapist facing new kidnapping and assault charges who was freed after the fund posted $350,000 in cash bail. The group also paid $100,000 to release Darnika Floyd, who was charged with second-degree murder, and $75,000 for Jaleel Stallings, who allegedly fired at a Minneapolis SWAT team before being acquitted at trial. Greg Lewin, then the fund’s interim executive director, told FOX 9 that same year, \"The last time we were down there, the clerk said, ‘We hate it when you bail out these sex offenders.’ I often don’t even look at a charge when I bail someone out.\" JONES AND MIYARES CLASH OVER MURDER TEXTS AS DEM REPEATEDLY INVOKES TRUMP AT HEATED, HIGH-STAKES DEBATE Darnika Floyd, charged with second-degree murder, was released after the Minnesota Freedom Fund posted $100,000 bail in 2020.

The news adds to a string of controversies for Jones, 35, who has already apologized for violent text messages directed at Republican leaders. In one exchange, he wrote that then–House Speaker Todd Gilbert gets \"two bullets to the head\" and that Gilbert’s wife Jennifer should \"watch her children die.\" Mavis Jones, wife of scandal-plagued Virginia AG candidate Jay Jones, D-Va., eportedly posted about her support of the Minnesota Freedom Fund in 2020, which bailed out accused murderers and rapists.

Jon Ossoff, described by CNN as the nation\u0027s \"most endangered Senate Democrat,\" has touted \"an unstoppable grassroots coalition.\" But, according to the latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings released, his campaign is being propped up by a lot of out-of-state money. Ossoff’s latest quarterly filing shows that more than 80% of the money he raised last period came from out-of-state donors. The report, which details contributions from individuals who have given at least $200 this cycle, also reveals that over half of his maxed-out donors hail from California, New York or the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia region. After the release of an October filing, Ossoff\u0027s team touted in a press release that, in the face of \"heavy spending from GOP Super PACs,\" it raised $12 million during the last third-quarter filing period that runs from July 1 through Sept. 30. The same press release said Ossoff\u0027s \"re-election juggernaut\" was \"overwhelmingly\" powered by small donors with an average of $36 from approximately 233,000 donors. If a donor has not given an aggregate of at least $200, that donor\u0027s contribution remains undisclosed in FEC filings.

Some GOP critics and Capitol Hill insiders have posited that the Georgia Democrat cannot break rank and vote to reopen the government, or he could risk losing his significant support from liberals around the country. (Megan Varner/Getty Images) Ossoff is running for re-election in a state Trump won in 2024, albeit by a thin two-point margin. He first arrived in Congress in 2021 after defeating incumbent Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., in a razor-thin election that required a runoff. During that first election cycle, according to The Washington Free Beacon, Ossoff raised 60% of his contributions from outside the state of Georgia. According to Ossoff\u0027s recent October FEC filing, California is leading the pack in terms of the most donations to his campaign during the third quarter, totaling about 20% of all donations. Georgia is second with about 17.5%. But when it comes to donors who have maxed out their contribution limits, more of those political donors came from California (33.3%) New York (15.65%) and Massachusetts (10.8%) than from Georgia, which accounted for only 6.1% of maxed-out donors who contributed to Ossoff in the third quarter.

Ann Selzer and The Des Moines Register, and the case will now land in Iowa State Court after an appeals court sided with the president and ruled a lower court had overstepped. Trump’s legal team, which has accused the defendants of \"brazen election interference\" with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris, originally requested the case be moved to Iowa State Court in May after the defendants \"removed\" the case to federal court. A federal judge denied the request at the time, but the Obama-appointed judge was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. In a sharply worded opinion, the 8th Circuit granted Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus — a rare judicial order used to correct clear legal errors — and directed a district judge to treat the case as dismissed \"without prejudice,\" allowing Trump to refile the case.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \"Today’s just and appropriate ruling by the 8th Circuit ensures that President Trump’s powerhouse case focused on the fake election interfering polls conducted and denominated by J. Ann Selzer, The Des Moines Register and its corporate owner Gannett will be litigated in Iowa State Court where it belongs,\" a spokesman for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital. \"These defendants have repeatedly engaged in unlawful gamesmanship to avoid State Court, and that ends today,\" the spokesman continued. \"President Trump will continue to hold those who traffic in fake news, lies and smears to account.\" Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), who represents Selzer, issued a statement. \"The 8th Circuit ruling was focused entirely on a technical point of civil procedure and said nothing about the merits of the case. This case is every bit as frivolous today as it was yesterday, and that fact will be borne out in whatever forum it is finally resolved,\" Corn-Revere told Fox News Digital. DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP\u0027S BALLROOM IS NO VANITY PROJECT, IT\u0027S ABOUT AMERICAN GRANDEUR J. Ann Selzer came under fire after releasing a hugely inaccurate poll ahead of the 2024 election showing Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in Iowa. Trump won the state by more than 13 points. (Getty Images/ The Bulwark Podcast via YouTube screenshot) Lark-Marie Antón, a spokesperson for The Des Moines Register\u0027s parent company, Gannett, believes the case belongs in federal court. \"We are assessing the court’s decision. Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit. In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly,\" Antón told Fox News Digital. The lawsuit was originally filed in December in Polk County, Iowa, and sought what it calls \"accountability for brazen election interference committed by\" The Des Moines Register and Selzer \"in favor of now-defeated former Democrat candidate Kamala Harris through use of a leaked and manipulated Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll\" published Nov. 2, 2024. \"The Harris Poll was no ‘miss’ but rather an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election,\" the lawsuit stated at the time, adding that \"defendants and their cohorts in the Democrat Party hoped that the Harris Poll would create a false narrative of inevitability for Harris in the final week of the 2024 Presidential Election.\" FORMER POLLSTER ANN SELZER HITS BACK AT CRITICISMS OVER IOWA POLL: \u0027THEY ARE ACCUSING ME OF A CRIME\u0027 Donald Trump arrives on stage during a campaign event at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, Jan. 14, 2024. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Selzer released her final Des Moines Register-sponsored poll showing Harris leading Trump by three points in Iowa just three days before the election. That shock poll showed a seven-point shift from Trump to Harris from September, when he had a four-point lead over the vice president in the same poll. Selzer’s poll was hyped up by the media in the days leading up to the election as her polling predictions had been historically accurate. Many suggested it implied a monumental shift in Midwest support for Harris in a red state, but the poll turned out to be way off. Trump thumped Harris in Iowa by more than 13 percentage points, the third straight time he\u0027d won the state and the first time any candidate had won there by double digits since 1980. Shortly after the election, Selzer announced she was done with election polling and moving on to \"other ventures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Lindsay Kornick and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

TRY IT NOW They make it easy to overlook Ruben Prey, one of only four returning players from the best Johnnies season in 25 years. But few players on the roster have progressed as much as the 6-foot-11 forward from Portugal. Coach Rick Pitino has said that Prey and North Carolina transfer Ian Jackson are the Red Storm’s most improved players since the summer. “His low-post game is certainly a great deal better. He came in here as a nondefender and now he can defend all five positions,” Pitino said. “He’s gone from a typical European basketball player, where defense is not the focus — more passing, cutting, scoring is the priority — and he’s adjusted to being a well-rounded basketball player at both ends of the floor.” Explore More Former NBAer, Duke star arrested after allegedly assaulting girlfriend Jordon Hudson poses for photos on sideline before North Carolina\u0027s crushing loss How to watch Dodgers-Blue Jays World Series Game 2 for free: Time, livestream Asked how they turned Prey into a quality defender, Pitino joked: “Fear.” Prey showed his progress in a recent scrimmage open to the media and again in the team’s exhibition win over Towson. He is a more confident player, more sure of himself, more aggressive. 3 St. John’s forward Ruben Prey dunks at practice on Oct. 16, 2025, in Queens, NY. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST “I feel like we work in player development every day,” Prey said. “It makes a big difference after one year if you work on it every day, day by day. After a year you’ll see the results. “I think the difference between college basketball and European basketball is the physicality of it. I think I’ve adapted already to the physicality. Every European goes through it.” Perhaps most importantly, Prey fits into how St. John’s wants to play. He’s a terrific athlete for his size, and can switch defensively, able to defend on the perimeter and serve as a rim protector in the paint. 3 Ruben Prey taking a shot at practice for St. John’s. Corey Sipkin for the NY POST It will be interesting to see how much Prey plays this coming season, considering the options Pitino has up front. He is the team’s fourth forward. But in the Towson game, Pitino wasn’t afraid to play three of his big men together, going an extended stretch with Hopkins, Prey and Mitchell on the floor at the same time. Prey isn’t worried about his role or minutes. That will come as long as he produces. 3 St. John’s forward Ruben Prey drives past Seton Hall’s Godswill Erheriene during a game last season. Bill Kostroun “I think I can help the team a lot,” Prey said. “So I don’t tend to think too much about the future and about playing time, because I know you’ll always get opportunities during the whole year. So I’m just trying to get ready and be the most ready when those opportunities come to me.” Prey began to feel comfortable late last season, and his playing time increased. He hit a big 3-pointer in the regular-season title clincher against Seton Hall and became a key reserve for Pitino. He was one of the best Johnnies players in the NCAA Tournament loss to Arkansas. Now, the hope is Prey is ready to make a leap as a sophomore.

Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock Mikie Sherrill, once comfortably ahead in the New Jersey governor’s race, has been getting plenty of attention over her stock trading lately, and not in a good way. Her fellow lawmakers should take note if they also have aspirations for higher office. The Democratic New Jersey congresswoman seemed like a shoo-in to succeed Phil Murphy as her state’s governor, an office that trended blue in recent years. Yet she is now neck-and-neck with Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a successful businessman before entering politics. Her problem: disclosures that she spent some considerable time day-trading stocks while she was in office, possibly — if her critics are right — profiting off nonpublic information to make profitable trades. Rising public disgust over her alleged insider trading could cost her the Nov. 4 election. Yes, to hear critics tell it, Sherrill’s acumen at timing the market — buying and selling stock armed with nonpublic information during the COVID pandemic a few years back — puts her in league with some of the best insider traders in the business. Ivan Boesky watch out! The truth is that Sherrill’s stock trades might look bad, but they’re not illegal or unusual. In fact, they are in line with other lawmakers who have gotten caught in this periodic scandal, which amounts to allegations that they used their access to nonpublic information to profit on stock trades.

Insider trading is notoriously difficult to prove because information is so fungible; warnings about the spread of COVID were all over the internet while Congress was being “privately” briefed in the matter.

Check out more newsletters A ‘something’ burger? Which makes this “scandal” seem like a nothing burger for Sherrill, right? Not quite. On the campaign trail, Sherrill has been oddly dissembling when asked for the details of the timing of her trades — particularly when the markets were freaking out over COVID back in 2020 — other than to point out she no longer trades stocks after being called out a few years ago. See Also How Mikie Sherrill’s family made millions after she was elected to Congress That’s why I did a deeper dive in the controversy by reviewing the timing of her trades, disclosed through various publicly available sources such as a website that tracks this stuff, known as “Quiver Quantitative.” I came across something odd: In April 2020, the New Jersey Globe ran a story stating that Sherrill and her husband “decided to convert to ETFs last December and instructed a financial adviser to begin the process during the first week of January, before receiving any briefings on COVID-19.” Odd, because her congressional disclosures show she bought lots of stocks in January 2020, the same month President Trump first downplayed the severity of the virus. Unless I’m missing something, she really didn’t start unloading shares until Feb. 20, 2020, when “Trump 1” began warning about COVID and the stock markets began crashing. Significant trading Another oddity; Sherrill was hardly a piker at trading stocks in 2019 and 2020 when she first got to Congress. True, she’s no Nancy Pelosi; Sherrill’s trading activity reached a high of around $2.4 million in 2020, dwarfed by the $39 million in trades for the former House speaker last year. Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey Jack Ciattarelli (L) and Democrat Mikie Sherrill (R) during a debate at New Brunswick Performing Arts Center on October 08, 2025.

Disclosure forms show they’re worth as much as $14 million. They own homes and property. Hedberg, whom she met at the Naval Academy, is a Wall Street banker who pulls in an estimated $3 million a year. (It was his late filing of stock trades that led to a small disclosure fine for Sherrill back in 2021. Through a rep he declined to comment.) Sherrill herself is no slouch; she was a helicopter pilot in the Navy, went on to become an accomplished private attorney at the firm Kirkland \u0026 Ellis before working as an assistant US attorney and then entering Congress. A spokesman for Sherrill’s campaign says “Mikie does not own or trade individual stocks, and has gone ‘above and beyond’ releasing the exact values of her finances to the dollar and while New Jerseyans have zero insight into Jack Ciattarelli’s net worth.” Again, she certainly isn’t the worst — or the first — lawmaker to be caught flat-footed trying to explain weirdness involving stock trading and whether they used the perks of their office to make money. Yet she does provide a cautionary tale; if you enter Congress, try focusing your time on working for the people back home and not being a day-trader.

The game ended following a risky decision by Belichick, in which the legendary coach decided to go for a two-point conversion in an attempt to take the lead rather than settle for a tie with an extra point.

The increase comes as a high-stakes showdown to replace Mayor Eric Adams pits former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an Independent, against Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Party nominee and beret-wearing Republican Curtis Sliwa. The New York City BOE reported a total of 79,409 early voter check-ins as the polls closed Saturday night – a sharp jump from the 15,418 who showed up when early voting began four years ago. 4 New Yorkers casting their ballots on the first day of in-person early voting in Manhattan on Oct. 25, 2025. Michael Nigro Officials said 24,046 ballots were cast in Manhattan, 22,105 in Brooklyn, 19,045 in Queens, 7,793 in the Bronx, and 6,420 in Staten Island. The numbers are staggeringly higher than first-day turnout in 2021, which recorded 4,563 voters in Manhattan, 3,751 in Brooklyn, 3,441 in Queens, 2,079 in the Bronx, and 1,584 in Staten Island, data showed.

Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, is currently leading in the polls by double digits in the race to oversee the city’s $115 billion budget and nearly 300,000-member workforce. His victory in the Democratic primary drew controversy because of his far-left views and he failed to get backing from many prominent mainstream Dems. Nevertheless, polls show the 34-year-old Queens Assemblyman trouncing Cuomo by nearly 20 points, 46.7% to 28.6%, while Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder trails in a distant third at 16.2%, according to a new survey of voters released Friday by Victory Insights. If elected, Mamdani, a Ugandan-born Palestine supporter, has vowed to arrest Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal if he sets foot in the city. 4 Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani taking a selfie with supporters during a campaign stop in Brooklyn on Oct. 25, 2025. Aristide Economopoulos Throughout the campaign, the mayoral candidates have fiercely clashed over hot-button issues, including crime, homelessness, affordability, and ties with Israel and President Trump. Adams, a centrist Democrat, suspended his faltering re-election bid last month after fundraising stalled amid a federal probe into corruption allegations, from which he was later cleared. Many races are unopposed or noncompetitive, with registered Democrats holding a more than 6 to 1 advantage over Republicans in New York City. The 2021 race pitted Democratic nominee Adams, who was an overwhelming favorite, against Sliwa during the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. Adams trounced Sliwa with 66.99 percent of the 1.1 million votes cast. 4 Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo greeting supporters outside an early voting site in Co-Op City in the Bronx on Oct. 25, 2025. J.C. Rice Cuomo’s spokesperson hailed the early turnout this year as a sign of hope for his campaign. “It’s been clear most voters don’t want New York City to be a socialist experiment with a diminished police force, no jails, decriminalized prostitution, a weakened education system that encourages mediocrity,” said Rich Azzopardi. “This is the most important election of our lifetime and the turnout thus far shows that New Yorkers know it.” A rep for Sliwa, meanwhile said they thought the numbers were good for them. “We actually have a solid get out the vote early voting effort. I’m positive a lot of this activity is ours. Cuomo has no ground game, doubt it’s much in his favor,” the rep said. Reps for Mamdani couldn’t immediately be reached.

Bill Kostroun/New York Post CINCINNATI — It’s been a typical week for the Jets, which is to say it’s been stressful and chaotic, and less about what’s actually in front of them — Sunday’s game at Cincinnati — and too much about peripheral nonsense. The week began with team owner Woody Johnson publicly throwing starting quarterback Justin Fields under the bus and leaving him as roadkill, blaming his struggles for the team’s 0-7 record. It continued with head coach Aaron Glenn deciding he was going to keep which quarterback will start — Fields or backup Tyrod Taylor — a secret most of the week, before it slipped that Fields would return under center with Taylor with a knee issue. Glenn played it this way to create a “competitive advantage” — though it’s highly unlikely Bengals defensive coordinator Al Golden lost a millisecond of REM sleep over the big reveal. Then there’s the prospect of facing Joe Flacco, the Bengals’ ageless wonder at quarterback who spent 2020-22 with the Jets with Johnson all but shoving him out the door as old, over the hill and finished.

Angela Boorn made the grisly discovery when she went to visit her uncle, 75-year-old Gerald McClellan — whom she lovingly considered her second father — at his studio apartment at LifeStream at Sun City on Oct. 16, according to AZ Family. When her usual cheerful greeting, “Uncle, I’m here,” was met with silence, the niece stepped inside and was met with the horrifying sight. 4 Gerald McClellan, 75, was found dead and decomposing in his room at LifeStream at Sun City on Oct. 16. AZ Family “It looked like a skeleton in a chair,” Boorn told the outlet, adding “the face, the eyes were hollowed out.” “It didn’t even look like a person because he had been there for so long.

Boorn — now wracked with guilt — moved her uncle to the Sun City facility in January after his wife passed away. She said she chose the location and paid $1,700 a month in rent, believing it had safeguards in place to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening, the outlet reported. One of those safety measures, Boorn said, was a daily check-in button installed in every room that residents are expected to press each morning to let staff know they were safe. 4 Angela Boorn, McClellan’s niece, made the grisly discovery and alleged he hadn’t been checked on for four days. AZ Family 4 Boorn said she believed the facility had safeguards in place to prevent tragedies like this from happening. AZ Family “Every day by 10 a.m., a staffing member was supposed to reach out to him or come check on him,” the shaken Waddell resident explained. “He didn’t push the button; they tried to call him, didn’t get a hold of him, and they still did not go check on him. It wasn’t one day, it wasn’t two days, it wasn’t three days, it was four.” Local authorities later confirmed that McClellan had likely been dead for three to four days before anyone at the independent living center finally called 911, according to the news station. 4 McClellan moved into the facility back in January after his wife died. AZ Family “LifeStream at Sun City is deeply saddened by the passing of one of our residents,” the facility said in a statement to the outlet. “Our heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to their family and loved ones during this difficult time.

The nation’s largest lender filed legal papers in Delaware on Friday demanding that a judge reverse an earlier ruling that required it to pay the lawyers for Charlie Javice and her convicted co-conspirator Olivier Amar. According to the filing, Javice’s team of lawyers across five law firms have billed JPMorgan approximately $60.1 million in legal fees and expenses, while Amar’s lawyers have billed the bank roughly $55.2 million in fees. 4 Charlie Javice was sentenced to seven years in prison last month after she was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase.

Bloomberg via Getty Images In total, the bank alleges Javice and Amar’s lawyers have racked up legal fees of $115 million, with one law firm receiving $35.6 million in reimbursements alone. In comparison, Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of defrauding investors in the Theranos case, reportedly ended up with a legal bill of roughly $30 million.

The court ruled that the advancement of fees was mandatory under the deal’s indemnification provisions, forcing JPMorgan to pay for their defense in criminal, civil, and SEC cases. 4 The bank is asking a Delaware court to be let off the hook for the convicts’ legal bills. REUTERS The bank is now trying to recoup those costs as part of a $287.5 million restitution order, which also includes other merger-related losses. Under the restitution order, Javice must repay just 10% of her post-prison income for 20 years, meaning JPMorgan is unlikely to recover much of the money. Javice, 33, told the court last month she took “full responsibility,” but prosecutors dismissed her apology as “hollow” and “self-serving.” Her defense team — led by Quinn Emanuel partner Alex Spiro, who charges more than $2,000 an hour — is expected to keep billing the bank during her appeal, despite the ongoing fight over reimbursement.

Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images The Blue Jays are a different kind of modern champion. They aren’t all about the home run. They do more than three true outcomes, and it works for them. Word around the game was that to win a championship you have to win the homer game (the past five champions were all top-five home run teams). Word was that it’s impossible to string hits against aces in October. But the Blue Jays aren’t like recent champions. They are contact specialists.

Harper told The Athletic in a story published Saturday that he has shown “total commitment to my team, and yet there is still trade talk.” “I made every effort to avoid this,” Harper, 33, told the outlet. “It’s all I heard in D.C. [with the Nationals]. I hated it. It makes me feel uncomfortable.” Dombrowski told The Post’s Jon Heyman that Philadelphia won’t trade Harper, though Harper told The Athletic that he hasn’t heard from Dombrowski or managing partner John Middleton since the Phillies were eliminated by the Dodgers in the National League Division Series earlier this month. 3 Bryce Harper reacts after scoring a run during the Phillies’ Oct. 8 game.

Harper hit .261 with an .844 OPS — his worst marks since 2019 and 2016, respectively — during the 2025 campaign, and while Dombrowski didn’t question the fact that Harper remains an All-Star in his season-ending press conference, he did wonder about whether he could rediscover the form that has allowed him to win multiple MVP awards. 3 Dave Dombrowski is pictured before a Phillies game in June 2023. USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con “Can he rise to the next level again? I don’t really know that answer,” Dombrowski said at the time. “And really, he’s the one that will dictate that more than anything else, is what it comes down to. I don’t think he’s content with the year that he had, and again, it wasn’t a bad year. “But when I think of Bryce Harper, you’re thinking elite, right? You’re thinking one of the top-10 players in baseball, and I don’t think it fit into that category. But again, very good player.” Harper, who has six years and approximately $153 million remaining on the 13-year deal that brought him from the Nationals to the Phillies after the 2018 season, also missed 30 games this year with a wrist injury. “All players get hurt,” Harper told The Athletic on Saturday. “I hurt my wrist this year and missed a month. Of course I don’t have full-year numbers. “It’s disappointing to hear me being questioned about my contribution to the team. Just really hurt by that notion because I love Philly so much.” Harper said that while he was “advised otherwise,” he doesn’t have an opt-out in his contract and wants to remain in Philadelphia. But Dombrowski’s comments added a strange twist to what will already be a critical offseason for the Phillies, who’ve made plenty of postseason runs with their current core but haven’t been able to snap a World Series drought that dates back to 2008. 3 Bryce Harper hits a home run during the Phillies’ Sept. 6 game. Imagn Images Kyle Schwarber and J.T.

Just hours before the 2025 Miss USA pageant was set to kick off in Nevada, Cooper, 23, announced on Instagram she wouldn’t be there to crown her successor. “As the new ownership and leadership of the Miss USA Organization, we made multiple attempts to welcome Miss Cooper to the 2025 Miss USA competition to crown her successor and end her reign with the dignity becoming her title. We respect her decision not to attend and wish her well,” Miss USA President Thom Brodeur said in a Saturday statement to The Post. 3 Alma Cooper made shockwaves when she announced she wouldn’t attend the 2025 Miss USA pageant. Getty Images A rep for Miss USA told The Post that they knew longhand that Cooper was skipping the pageant. “We invited Alma and knew ahead of time that she would not be in attendance well before last night,” a Miss USA rep said.

Getty Images The beauty queen’s parents were tight-lipped about their daughter’s decision, with Cooper’s mom Oralia declining to comment and her father, Stacey, claiming he didn’t know why Alma stayed away. “I’m a hunter and fisher… I’m retired military… I think it’s great she’s in Miss USA but the mom knows all about that… my main concern is that she finishes school. I’m a Dad, all I care about is that she finishes school at Stanford,” Stacey Cooper told The Post.

Getty Images “Alma spent the last 14 months keeping a title alive all on her own. No team behind her. To be Miss USA with no team and no salary is impossible and yet she was determined to keep going,” Miss USA 2011 Alyssa Campanella wrote on Instagram. Cooper had taken a break from her graduate studies in order to focus on her responsibilities as Miss USA and her Army Recruiting work, People Magazine reported. She was the first active-duty Army officer to win Miss USA. “For the past year, I have done my absolute best to honor the prestigious title while also serving as [First Lieutenant] Cooper in the U.S. Army,” Cooper told People. This is not the first time a Miss USA has caused drama for the organization. In 2024, both Miss USA titleholder Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished their crowns.

Getty Images Gambling content 21+. The New York Post may receive an affiliate commission if you sign up through our links. Read our editorial standards for more information. The last game on Saturday’s college football card features Colorado and Utah, two teams trying to find steady footing in 2025. You could argue that this is a dead-rubber game, with both teams out of the running in the Big 12, but Colorado and Utah have plenty to prove down the stretch. Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes are trying to prove they can put together a decent season without Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders, while Utah is hoping to build its program back into a contender. The Utes are 13.5-point favorites in the Week 9 curtain-closer.

Smith refuses to back down after Kash Patel scolds ESPN star over NBA gambling probe comments The most important note about this game is that Utah quarterback Devon Dampier, who was a Heisman hopeful not a month ago, is listed as questionable for Saturday. If Dampier can’t play, the Utes will turn to freshman Byrd Ficklin to guide the ship. You can expect this market to be volatile as bettors try to stay on top of Dampier’s status. Outside of the homework you need to do around Dampier, what really makes this a fun game to handicap is the fact that both of these teams are probably better than perceived. The Utes are 5-2 with disappointing losses in crucial games, results that are coloring this campaign with grey skies, but under the hood things look pretty promising. Utah grades out as the 14th-best team in the country by SP+, Bill Connelly’s catch-all metric, putting them on par with the likes of Miami, Vanderbilt, and Ole Miss. Utah quarterback Devon Dampier is listed as questionable for Saturday. Getty Images The defense is the story in Salt Lake City, as the Utes are rank eighth in SP+, 10th in points allowed per game, and 23rd in yards per play. Dampier’s status is critical, but you can count on this defense to be the best unit on the field on Saturday. Colorado’s season also feels disappointing, but that’s because of what transpired in Boulder in the past two campaigns under Deion Sanders. This, the first of Sanders’ tenure without Travis Hunter and his son, Shedeur, was always going to be bumpy. But Colorado has handled it well. Betting on College Football?

The Buffaloes had one rough outing against Houston, but they’ve been game against some really strong opponents. They lost by one score to No. 7 Georgia Tech, by three to No. 11 BYU, and their 14-point loss to TCU mostly came down to turnovers. The Buffs are hanging in there against better opposition. With Dampier banged-up and Colorado playing like a team determined to make the most of a roller-coaster season, this spread looks tempting, especially with Utah coming off a heart-breaker against its bitter rival on Saturday.

The Utes technically are still alive in the Big 12, and thus, in the hunt for a spot in the dance, but it would take something pretty close to a miracle for them to get in.

What our Post expert thinks about Colorado vs. Utah It’s been a peculiar season for Colorado. The Buffaloes have had some encouraging results, most notably their win over Iowa State last weekend, but they’ve also come up short against teams like Houston, TCU, and Georgia Tech. A win over Utah would be another step in the right direction for Deion Sanders and Colorado as they try to rebuild the program after the departure of Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter.

Digital forensic evidence showed a member of security at the Louvre was in contact with individuals thought to be the perpetrators prior to the brazen daylight robbery on Oct.19, the Telegraph reported Saturday. “There is digital forensic evidence that shows there was co-operation with one of the museum’s security guards and the thieves,” a source told the Telegraph. 3 Heisters entered through the second-floor balcony of the Louvre where there were no security cameras. Getty Images “Sensitive information was passed on about the museum’s security, which is how they were aware of the breach.” The daring thieves were able to get in and out of the museum in mere minutes using a second-floor balcony that was not recorded by security cameras — and made off on scooters with eight pieces of France’s crown jewels.

In the wake of the shocking robbery, the most precious national jewels stored at the Louvre were transferred to the Bank of France. 3 The collection of crown jewels was valued at roughly $100 million. AP The loot that was stolen included a sapphire diadem, necklace and a single earring from a set linked to 19th-century Queens Marie-Amelie and Hortense. Heisters also absconded with an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife. Empress Eugenie’s diamond diadem and her corsage-bow brooch were also boosted. Egunie’s emerald-set imperial crown, which contains more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum in a damaged, but recoverable, state.

Getty Images Ravens bettors aren’t happy with how the franchise handled Lamar Jackson’s injury status this week. The star quarterback will miss his third straight game with a hamstring strain on Sunday when the Ravens host the Bears in Baltimore, despite Jackson appearing to be ready to go less than 24 hours ago. Jackson had been listed as a full participant in Friday’s practice, seemingly paving the way for his return to the field after going down in a loss to the Chiefs during Week 4. The betting public acted accordingly, with the Ravens jumping from roughly 3.5-point favorites to as high as 7-point favorites at some sportsbooks after the good Jackson news dropped. Lamar Jackson looks to pass prior to an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on September 28, 2025. Getty Images The optimism around Jackson quickly disappeared Saturday Jackson’s practice status was retroactively downgraded a day before the game from “full” to “limited” for Friday’s workout and shockingly ruled out for Sunday’s game, puzzling bettors, fantasy football players and, perhaps most importantly, the Bears. Once again, the betting line took a major turn, this time toward Chicago, who went from a 3.5-point underdog to a razor-thin 1.5-point underdog as of this writing after news broke that Tyler Huntley would be the opposing quarterback rather than Jackson.

Smith refuses to back down after Kash Patel scolds ESPN star over NBA gambling probe comments Dodgers even World Series thanks to ace\u0027s complete-game gem Jordon Hudson poses for photos on sideline before North Carolina\u0027s crushing loss Those who took the Ravens, who at 1-5 desperately need a win to stay in the playoff hunt, in the meantime, were, unsurprisingly, not happy about the switcharoo. “I placed a bet, and I know other people placed bets based on the fact he was a full [participant in] practice,” an X user by the name of @BballMichael wrote. “It’s the Raven franchise being the ravens, though. Trying to get Chicago to prepare for Lamar when they knew he wasn’t playing. Such a shady franchise.” “…how convenient after I placed a bet last night,” another user who goes by the handle @darrenhoughton_ wrote on the platform. “Everyone who picked the ravens to win should get a refund if they lose now since Lamar’s out.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson sits on the bench after being replaced by Cooper Rush during the second half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. AP NFL Network reported that Jackson participated with the scout team on Friday, indicating that he may not have truly been a full participant in practice as the team listed him as. The Ravens released a statement later on Saturday, stating that Jackson “was present and participated fully in [their] entire Friday practice,” but decided to make the designation change because he worked out with the backups “Upon further evaluation and after conferring with the league office, because Lamar didn’t take starter reps in practice, we updated our report to reflect his practice participation,” the statement read. The NFL’s injury report policy states that “participation on the scout team” due to an injury “by a player whose normal repetitions would be with the starters” would require the team to list the player as “limited.” Some have speculated that the Ravens could get some punishment from the league, which takes compliance with injury reports extremely seriously, calling it a “cornerstone of public confidence in the NFL” in its policy, for the Jackson snafu. Teams are subject to fines for violating the NFL’s injury report policy. In 2023, the Falcons were fined $75,000 and head coach Arthur Smith $25,000 for failing to disclose an illness of running back Bijan Robinson.

Tied 2-2 heading into the bottom of the sixth inning, the first three Blue Jays batters reached base and a walk and single resulted in two runs scored. The bases were still loaded when the Jays sent Addison Barger in to pinch hit for left fielder Davis Schneider. With a 413 ft. shot into right field, Barger recorded the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history. After that, a two-run shot from Alejandro Kirk made the score 11-2.

The girl underwent surgery at Cohen’s Children’s Medical Center in Queens to remove the object after the Wednesday night attack in the family’s apartment on East 173rd Street near Boone Avenue in the Bronx, the sources said. “She’s not going to be right,” a source said. 5 The bloody rampage started at the family’s Bronx apartment arund 11 p.m. Wednesday, cops said. Christopher Sadowski Her stepfather, Joshua Burnside, 28, allegedly stabbed the girl in the head, and plunged the knife into his 31-year-old wife’s stomach and slashed her face, cops said. A neighbor said the desperate mom was knocking on doors following the terrifying episode, saying “Help me! Help me!” — and even asked him for a knife.

We don’t want to bring problems.” 5 The 12-year-old was stabbed in the back and had a tool driven up her nose, police and sources said. Christopher Sadowski “We were the first ones that came out, other people came out,” the neighbor said. “Somebody else told her to go away.” The accused maniac was arrested and charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and acting in a manner injurious to a child for the cold-blooded attack, cops said. Those charges are expected to be upgraded to attempted murder, sources said. The woman was “covered in blood,” the neighbor said. 5 It was unclear why the stepdad flew off the handle, cops said. Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock “She’s saying, ‘Oh, I just got attacked. My husband of eight years attacked me,’” he recalled. The neighbor, who said he was worried about his own kids, called 911. “She ended up running back upstairs,” he said. “We called the cops, by the time they came, we just saw, like, the aftermath of them carting the kids off and the man and her. It was a horrendous and very sad situation.” 5 A neighbor said she heard the screams but was afraid to come out of her apartment. Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock The mom’s ex-boyfriend, who met her when both of them lived in Philadelphia, was shocked to learn of the incident. “He shouldn’t have done what he did,” the ex-beau, who asked to remain anonymous, said. The young girl used to call him Daddy, the man recalled. 5 The little girl had to undergo emergency surgery at a Queens hospital, police sources said. Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock “He is a monster,” the ex said of the suspect. “When you do something like that, it means you’ve got a really serious problem. You were trying to kill them.” It was unclear why the stepdad flew off the handle, cops said. “This doesn’t make sense,” the woman’s ex lamented. “I don’t know what else to do but cry.” Two younger children in the apartment, a 5-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl, are Burnside’s natural children and were uninjured, police sources said. Burnside had an injury to his wrist and was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition. It wasn’t clear how he was hurt. The knife was recovered on the scene, cops said.

Wallace, 51, a former Detroit Pistons teammate of accused schemer Chauncey Billups, claimed in a 2023 interview that refs conspired to rig games using “secret emails.” “With the referees, that’s why I was just saying, as I got older, I didn’t have to do all the cussing or come with attitudes,” Wallace, who has the third most technical fouls in NBA history, told the Underdog NBA. 3 Four-time NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace said in a 2023 interview that NBA referees were “cheating” during his playing career. Getty Images “Now I’m just hitting them with logic. Like, ‘Oh, so y’all got that email last night, huh?’ Then they flare up,” he said. “And I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, I know about y’all email s–ts.

Canada had been “caught, red handed” using “selective audio and video” of Reagan’s 1987 radio address in an ad opposing tariffs, the president wrote on Truth Social, claiming the move was designed to sway an upcoming US Supreme Court case on his authority to issue the levies. “Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. 5 President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with Canada Saturday, announcing a 10% hike on tariffs.

The ads — which use clips of Reagan warning that tariffs “hurt” Americans — triggered Trump on Thursday to terminate trade negotiations with Canada. 5 Ontario Premier Doug Ford (left) previously agreed to pause the ad campaign after speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. REUTERS The Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the Ontario government “did not seek nor receive permission” to use Reagan’s remarks and was “reviewing its legal options.” The foundation accused the province of misrepresenting Reagan’s speech, bolstering Trump’s claims that the ad was deceptive. The Ontario ad features Reagan’s 1987 comments that tariffs “hurt” Americans — remarks the province said were used to illustrate how protectionist policies raise prices and strain trade relationships. 5 The ad contains clips of Reagan claiming that tariffs hurt Americans. x/fordnation The one-minute spot has aired on major US networks including Fox, NBC and CNBC — and was slated for national placement during the World Series broadcast. Ford defended the campaign as an effort to “initiate a conversation” about the economic fallout of tariffs, saying it had already reached “US audiences at the highest levels.” In a post on X, he said Ontario would continue airing the ad through the first two World Series games — featuring the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers — before the pause takes effect. 5 The ad ran during Game 1 of the World Series last night. x/fordnation Trump, speaking to reporters before leaving for Asia, dismissed Ford’s defense and accused Canada of trying to “illegally influence the United States Supreme Court.” He called the ad “really dishonest” and “crooked.” Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister earlier this year, has been seeking to restart trade talks after Trump imposed sweeping 35% tariffs on Canadian goods, including steel, aluminum and cars. The new increase announced on Saturday widens that penalty further, raising fears of another full-blown trade war between the two allies. The Post has sought comment from the Canadian government.

I just need to send them a 15 to 30-second video,” she said. Her process, which takes an hour and a half, begins with her designing a pattern in Adobe Illustrator, printing it out and taping it on the pumpkin. She then uses the thumbtack to make holes around the outlines — and then spends 30 minutes carving it out. 4 The Oklahoma graphic artist poses with her Lady Gaga creation.

Cop-turned-demonologist Chris DeFlorio is dishing for the first time about how he rid his former haunt – the 32nd Precinct in Harlem – of a malevolent spirit that had been tormenting officers for years. DeFlorio, 54, has been slaying the supernatural full-time with his wife, Harmony, since leaving the force in 2021. But one of his final missions in uniform resembled something out of “Ghostbusters” after a rookie cop reported a terrifying encounter inside the precinct’s fourth-floor bunk room. 5 One of ex-NYPD officer Chris DeFlorio’s final missions in uniform was slaying an “evil” spirit at the NYPD 32nd Precinct station house in Harlem. J.C. Rice “The officer in question was working a midnight shift. He’d just finished his shift and instead of going home, he wanted to go upstairs and take a break. He was sleeping in the bunkroom … and at that time, he felt there was something walking behind him,” recalled DeFlorio, who spent 20 years with the boys in blue. “He jumped up, he looked around, but there was no one in the room. He tried to forget it, went back to sleep, and not too long after, he felt gripping on his legs. Something was holding him down, and it was bouncing on the couch that he was laying on.” Explore More 1 dead, 6 injured in mass shooting at university homecoming event Bozo clad in full Nazi uniform breaks woman\u0027s nose outside Georgia college bar Third Disney World death in 10 days casts pall over Florida\u0027s Magic Kingdom After escaping the alleged spirit’s grasp, the cop hit the lights and “didn’t see anybody in the room,” DeFlorio said. “But when he looked towards the door, he saw a shadow of a person walking out.” Word of the hair-raising, May 8, 2020, encounter spread fast through the station house, according to DeFlorio and Byron Pena, another retired officer who’d had his own eerie run-in years earlier. 5 The May 10, 2020, exorcism came two days after a rookie cop had a terrifying encounter with the alleged spirit while sleeping in the precinct’s fourth-floor bunk room. Courtesy of Chris DeFlorio 5 Byron Pena, another retired cop, told The Post he’d had his own eerie run-in with the ghost almost two decades before DeFlorio’s exorcism. J.C. Rice Pena, 58, said he felt “relieved” to hear about the spooky, alleged incident – and that something would finally be done about the malicious spirit. “After that officer had his experience, I stopped him in the stairwell and I asked him about what happened, and he told me the story,” Pena told The Post. “Back in the last blackout we had in the early 2000s, I slept in the dorm room upstairs, and I tossed and turned all night – I couldn’t sleep. “I just had an eerie feeling. I kept looking at the door, I kept looking at the window – it was just so uncomfortable. It was just a weird feeling that I couldn’t explain, and I never mentioned it to anybody. … But there was a presence there.” 5 DeFlorio didn’t know if he would make it out of the exorcism alive — but one hour later, “you could walk directly into that room and it felt like a different room. There was a light feeling to it,” he said. Courtesy of Chris DeFlorio Petrified from that night, Pena never stepped foot in the bunk room again during his 28 years at the precinct – even after DeFlorio was called on by administrators to perform an exorcism in the wee hours of May 10, 2020. That morning, DeFlorio faced the demon. “When I walked into that bunk room, this was something that you couldn’t sense with your five senses,” he recounted.

By Georgia Worrell Published Oct. 25, 2025, 4:49 p.m. ET Nearly 6,000 serious sex offenders live in NYC — where a legal loophole allows convicted predators to live frighteningly close to schools and children’s playgrounds, The Post has learned. Paul Brown, a level 3 sex offender — the most serious classification, where the ex-con is considered most likely to re-offend — did seven years in prison for attempting to rape a 7-year-old girl in Brownsville, Brooklyn, according to records and police sources. Brown was released in November 2009 and returned to custody two more times in 2009 and 2012 for unknown violations, records show. 4 Paul Brown, a level 3 sex offender, did seven years in prison for attempting to rape a 7-year-old girl — but now lives frighteningly close to a Bronx school and playground. Division of Criminal Justice Services But because of a loophole in the state law — which prohibits sexual predators from living within 1,000 feet of playgrounds and schools, but only while the offender is on parole or probation — the 49-year-old lives just 450 feet from Edenwald Playground and 750 feet from PS 112 in the Bronx neighborhood of Wakefield. Two local moms, Jenifer Ramirez and Yakira Colon, were horrified to learn of the sicko’s proximity to their kids’ school and playground — and that a whopping 135 other offenders live in their zip code, the second-most in the city. Explore More 1 dead, 6 injured in mass shooting at university homecoming event Bozo clad in full Nazi uniform breaks woman\u0027s nose outside Georgia college bar Third Disney World death in 10 days casts pall over Florida\u0027s Magic Kingdom “I am very surprised because I thought it was safe here,” Colon, 34, told The Post, adding that her 10- and 6-year-old sons and 8-year-old daughter are in the playground nearly every day. “I feel very suspicious of the area now,” echoed Ramirez, 40, who has a 14-year-old daughter. “We know that many kids tell their moms, ‘Mama, we want to go to the park now,’ and then the kids go alone. What will happen if there’s a predator? The kids don’t know how to defend themselves. We thought it was safe, but I don’t feel secure anymore.” 4 The loophole in state law allows Brown to live just 450 feet away from Edenwald Playground in Wakefield. J.C. Rice “If parents let their kids go to the park alone, in reality, there’s going to be consequences, by these people who are not healthy in the head,” agreed Colon. “But it’s tough – it’s a dilemma – because many parents have to work and can’t be with the children all the time.” The same loophole allows level 3 offender Victor Guardiola — convicted in 2010 of sexually abusing his 10-year-old granddaughter, and sodomizing another 10-year-old girl in 1989 — to reside 600 feet away from Martin Luther King Jr. Playground in East New York, the registry shows.

Check out more newsletters Lax location restrictions play into the hands of child predators, experts say. “We know from seasoned sex crime investigators is that a lot of sex offenders are disproportionately likely to commit sex offenses close to where they live,” said Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor and director of Women’s Equal Justice. 4 Moms Jenifer Ramirez and Yakira Colon were horrified to learn of Brown’s proximity to their kids’ school and playground. LP Media The loophole is the reason state Assemblyman Joe Sempolinski (R-Allegany) is fighting to pass a bill which would prohibit sex offenders from residing within a quarter mile — or 1,320 feet — from any school, playground or park regardless of their parole or probation status. Convicted predators “don’t magically get better when their parole is up,” Sempolinski told The Post. “They’re no longer incarcerated, but we need to make sure that we’re taking steps to protect kids at all times, and I think it’s a pretty reasonable ask that we, as a state, say that people who have committed and been convicted of crimes of this nature should not be living near places where kids congregate.” 4 Victor Guardiola, a level 3 offender, resides 600 feet away from Martin Luther King Jr. Playground in East New York. Division of Criminal Justice Services The legislation has been around since 2012 but has repeatedly died in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, records show. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who has reportedly blocked bills that would benefit sex crime victims, did not respond to inquiries about the latest proposed legislation. A total of 5,750 level 2 and 3 sex offenders — the most serious of three designations — live in the five boroughs, according to a Post analysis of the state registry, which is updated daily. The state registry lookup can be found here. The five zip codes with the highest concentrations of level 2 and 3 sex offenders include: 10035, which encompasses Ward’s Island and part of East Harlem, is home to 459 offenders. Most of them them are in psychiatric centers and men’s shelters on Ward’s Island. 10466, which covers Wakefield, has 136 offenders. At least 55 reside at Project Renewal Ana’s Place, a 108-bed shelter for mentally-ill men at 430 Bronx Blvd. 11207, which encompasses East New York in Brooklyn, is home to 135 offenders. 10457, which covers parts of Belmont, Mt. Hope and Tremont in the Bronx, counts 129 offenders. 11208, which encompasses parts of Brooklyn’s East New York and Cyprus Hills, and is home to 128 offenders. Melinda Perkins, the district manager for Brooklyn Community Board 5, which covers part of East New York, called Guardiola’s proximity to Edenwald Playground “terrible,” and blasted city agencies for allowing the nabe to become “oversaturated” with sex offenders compared to other areas. “Certain facilities and services should be shared across the city, and shouldn’t be oversaturated in any one community board — especially those communities that have had a history of neglect and disinvestment like East New York,” Perkins told The Post. Even some of the city’s ritziest zip codes are home to a significant number of level 2 and 3 sex offenders, including: 11222, which covers Brooklyn’s Greenpoint, where 45 offenders live. The majority of them — 32 — reside in Home-Life Services, a homeless shelter complex on Clay Street and Manhattan Avenue. 11201, Brooklyn Heights, is home to 17 predators. 11211, which covers Williamsburg in Brooklyn, has 17 offenders. 11217, or Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill, includes 15 predators. 10010, which encompasses Kips Bay in Manhattan, has 13 offenders. Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa is not just in favor of restricting where sex offenders are allowed to live — “but I’m also for monitoring their activities and where they’re going” using technology like ankle bracelets, he said. “That’s the only way you can stop it, if you make that mandatory,” Sliwa said. “They can live outside the zone, but what prevents them from just walking over and hanging out in a playground, in the park or outside of schools? “We have to protect the children . . . and the demons that lurk within [offenders] may strike up at a moment’s notice.” Level 1 sex offenders — who are considered the least likely to reoffend — do not appear in the state’s public registry, but as of Oct. 1, there were 2,849 of them residing across the five boroughs, according to the latest data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.

That meant even more to her than the hundreds of television and movies roles she played.” 14 June Lockhart poses in 1944.

Maloney in 1951 and along with Elizabeth, they also shared daughter Anne. The former flames divorced in 1959. Lockhart, who was born on June 25, 1925 in New York City, began her acting career at age 8 in the 1933 stage production of “Peter Ibbetson” at the Metropolitan Opera House. By 1938, Lockhart made her film debut as Belinda Cratchit in “A Christmas Carol” at age 13 alongside her parents Gene and Kathleen Lockhart. 14 The Cratchit family at Christmas dinner in a scene from “A Christmas Carol” in 1938. Bettmann Archive “I thought my parents were wonderful as the Cratchits, and it was just great fun to see how a film was made,” Lockhart recalled while speaking to Ames Tribune in 2014. “I loved the Victorian costumes.” “We used to perform it every Christmas at home for our dinner guests,” Lockhart shared. “So I had already appeared in it, with my parents, in our living room for many years prior to doing it for MGM.” She added her family was thrilled when her first-ever words in a movie were “I know, I know — sausages.” 14 Guy Williams, June Lockhart in “Lost in Space.” ©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection “It’s become a family joke,” Lockhart stated, “and we all shriek with laughter when we watch it now.” The stage vet was best known for playing Ruth on the television series “Lassie,” and Maureen Robinson in the 1960s television series “Lost in Space.” Many fans told Lockhart that watching “Lost in Space” is what inspired them to become scientists. 14 June Lockhart, Hugh Reilly, Jon Provost in “Lassie.” Courtesy Everett Collection As she teased to NPR in 2004, “I did ‘Lassie’ for six years, and I never had anybody come up to me and say, ‘It made me want to be a farmer.\u0027” Lockhart also had a cameo in the 1998 movie adaptation of “Lost in Space,” as well as on Netflix’s 2021 reboot. In real life, the film star became a NASA spokespoerson. Lockhart was honored by NASA with the Exceptional Public Achievement Medal for her impact on space exploration in 2013. 14 June Lockhart, daughter Lizabeth Lockhart and her granddaughter attend the 50th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.

No other actress has received this honor.” During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Lockhart starred in a mixture of iconic roles, including “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944), “She-Wolf of London” (1946), “Bury Me Dead” (1947), “Troll” (1986) and “One Night at McCool’s” (2001). She also guest starred on some of the most beloved series: “Bewitched,” “Happy Days,” “Magnum P.I., “Falcon Crest,” “Full House,” “Roseanne,” “7th Heaven,” “Beverly Hills, 90210,” “General Hospital” and “Grey’s Anatomy.” 14 June Lockhart in “Full House.” Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images Having worked in multitude of early Westerns, Lockhart told Burlington County Times in 2015: “I loved the period costumes with the long gowns and their cinched-in waists. The stories were also marvelously written and could be quite provocative for their time.” She earned her first Tony Award for outstanding performance by a newcomer for her 1947 Broadway debut in “For Love or Money.” She donated the trophy to the Smithsonian. Lockhart returned to Broadway in 1955 for “The Grand Prize.” 14 June Lockhart arrives at Warner Home Video’s 60th anniversary DVD release reception and screening of “Meet Me in St. Louis” at the Directors Guild on April 4, 2004.

But theater is night after night after night.” Lockhart also has two Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame – one for her film career and another for her work in television. Despite playing an on-screen mom a lot of the time, Lockhart made it known that her real life persona was much more fun. 14 June Lockhart attends the Actors Fund’s 17th annual Tony Awards viewing party.

I do lots of things that don’t go hand-in-hand with my image.” Lockhart even did a voiceover part for the cartoon sitcom “Ren and Stimpy,” as it was her favorite show. “I am such a fan, I try never to miss an episode,” she gushed. 14 June Lockhart attend the Early TV Memories First-Class stamp dedication ceremony.

Francis Chung/POOL via CNP/INSTARimages.com Those discussions were meant to set the stage for a face-to-face between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary. But both sides walked away from the planned meeting after Moscow rejected Trump’s demand to stop the war in Ukraine along the current battle lines.

The US, meanwhile, is hammering out a deal with Ukraine to supply the war-torn country with Patriot interceptor missiles, a critical need for Ukrainian cities’ air defense systems.

The complaints about the six-story townhouse at 80 Washington Place — referred to in the sprawling indictment as the “Washington Place” — were made while it was one of two illegal casinos where prosecutors say mobsters swindled their gambling victims out of millions. Officials say the fraudsters began using the home — located just steps from Washington Square Park on one of the city’s most desirable blocks — to run their scheme around January 2021, which is just when the complaints began to pour in. 3 The townhouse at 80 Washington Place was allegedly used to host illegal poker games where mobsters stole millions from their victims. The first call to 311 rolled in around 3 a.m. on Jan. 16, 2021 for a mass gathering on the sidewalk outside and a similar complaint about loud talking on the street was made just four days later at 2:28 a.m., records show. That’s when the townhouse apparently turned up the volume and inundated the otherwise sleepy neighborhood with ear-splitting noise in the middle of the night.

It’s not clear whether the rambunctious and hard-partying alleged criminals were ever dinged for their behavior. The NYPD, which is dispatched to most noise complaints, noted that they “responded to the complaint and took action to fix the condition,” but could not immediately tell The Post whether that involved tickets or summonses, or simply verbal warnings. 3 The scammers allegedly used sophisticated cheating tech like rigged X-ray card tables, and crooked card shufflers.

Those extra pounds put added strain on the cardiovascular system, can narrow coronary arteries and even affect heart rhythm. Worse yet, studies suggest that carrying excess weight from a young age is even more harmful to heart health than becoming obese as an adult. 3 Risk factors for heart disease include obesity, lack of exercise, unhealthy diet and high blood pressure. Africa Studio – stock.adobe.com The numbers for other top heart disease risk factors aren’t much better: See Also I’m a cardiologist — the heart health signs you shouldn’t ignore in your 40s, 50s and 60s One in 5 Americans ages 12 to 19 have cholesterol levels outside the healthy range. One in 3 youngsters ages 12 to 17 have prediabetes. One in 7 children and teens ages 8 to 19 have blood pressure that’s higher than normal. “Most children are born healthy, but unfortunately much of the benefit of heart health is lost during childhood, and currently less than 5% of US children enjoy ideal cardiovascular health,” Dr. David Jacobs, a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota, said in a statement. Adding to the concern, many young Americans are engaging in behaviors that further increase their risk of being diagnosed with heart disease. Only about one in four US high school students get the recommended hour of daily exercise, leaving many without the benefits of physical activity, such as a stronger heart, better blood flow and reduced inflammation. Use of cigarettes, vapes and other nicotine products has also gone up, increasing from 21% of 18- to 23-year-olds in 2002 to 43% in 2018. 3 Smoking is responsible for one in every four deaths from cardiovascular disease. aleksandr_yu – stock.adobe.com The good news: many of these biomarkers and behaviors can be changed, and research shows that making adjustments can significantly boost your chances of preventing heart disease. The American Heart Association recommends quitting smoking and vaping, cutting back on alcohol and sticking to a healthy diet packed with nutrient-rich foods. Adults should aim for 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, and get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you have diabetes, regular checkups are key to keeping blood sugar in check. For anyone over 20, cholesterol should be checked every four to six years. “By making one healthy lifestyle change, you’ll often snowball the benefits into others,” Dr. Mingsum Lee, a cardiologist at Kaiser Permanente, said in a statement. She explained that exercise, for example, can curb cigarette cravings, improve sleep and boost mental well-being — all critical for heart health. “Understanding your risk factors and working to correct them early is a critical first step down the path of better cardiovascular health,” Lee said.

Q: Describe your on-field mentality. A: I want to be explosive, I want to be fierce. But also smart and calculated. Like when I’m in the run game and the pass game, I want people to be fearful of having to guard me, having to go block against me. Q: Give me an example of your fierceness. A: If I have a safety playing flatfooted, standing right at 10 yards, I want to run straight through him. Obviously not directly down the middle because that’s OPI [offensive pass interference], but like run through his shoulder. My mindset is if you’re standing flatfooted, you are disrespecting me. You’re telling me you can just sit there and be able to cover me, which I take as disrespect. Q: You believe in intimidation? A: Yeah, I mean, football is a physical game, and some people, if you beat them down enough, people are not going to keep rising to the challenge. Explore More Brian Burns opens up to The Post on early chase of iconic Giants record, ‘psycho’ Cam Skattebo’s influence Peter Schrager opens up on journey from WFAN caller to ESPN NFL analyst Cam Skattebo’s ‘built-up anger’ over doubters fuels his punishing Giants mentality Q: What’s an example of your physical or mental toughness? A: The big thing for me is doing things even when you don’t feel like it. You never feel like you did in July for training camp. Q: How does your play style compare to Cam Skattebo’s? A: I think me and Skatt and Jaxson [Dart] kind of get along because it’s just like gritty ball. It’s not always going to look sexy, you know? Like sometimes it looks a little dirty, but you get it done, you get that extra yard, you lower your shoulder and you go for two more. That’s not cute. But we’re not running out of bounds, we’re not trying to be cute, it’s hard-nosed football. Q: From your Instagram, referring to your mother: “You believed in me when no one else did, not even myself.” A: I was a young kid, like wasn’t always a most confident person, and my mom just saw something in me, was hard on me. Like there were times where I didn’t really know how my life was going to go and what I was going to end up doing. And she kept believing in me, kept trusting me, kept loving me — even when I gave her a lot of reasons not to. And I am in her debt for that, because I wouldn’t be here without her. 5 Theo Johnson of the New York Giants celebrates QB Jaxon Dart’s fourth-quarter touchdown. Kai River Kanzer / New York Post Q: Your mother was a victim of domestic abuse. Because of what you and your five brothers endured, did you ever seek therapy? A: Yeah. … At first it wasn’t very beneficial. It wasn’t until I was a little older until I started to see it being beneficial. And I say that because if your heart is not in it, then you’re not going to get anything out of it. Like, if you’re just going to check a box or you’re just like, “Man, this is dumb but my mom’s making me do this,” or “the school’s making me do this,” or whatever, you’re not going to get anything out of it. Someone can’t make you improve and do the work. But it wasn’t until I chose to do it, then I was like, “Alright, this is something I want to do, this is an area that I want to improve in,” that I started to see the benefits of it. Q: Was dealing with the anger, or channeling it, part of the therapy? A: I never had anger issues or anything like that. Q: What did you learn about yourself? A: The big thing for me is just giving myself grace. Not being so hard on myself. Not trying to be perfect … perfectionist. And that it’s OK to not be OK sometimes. But just learning ways to decompress or deal with those feelings in a healthy way rather than going to toxic ways of kind of dealing with things. Q: How do you feel about your father? A: I honestly don’t have any feelings towards him. Bad or good, I was a very small kid when I last saw him or had any interaction with him, so I don’t have any negative things to say. … Obviously there’s bad things that happened, but I was a kid, and holding on to negative things from when you’re a child is not good for you, so I wouldn’t say I have any crazy feelings one way or another about him. 5 Giants tight end Theo Johnson (84) runs toward the end zone against Denver Broncos cornerback Jahdae Barron to score during the second half of an NFL football game in Denver. AP Q: Does your mother come to home games? A: Yeah, she’s been to two games this year. Q: What it is like playing in New York? A: I love it, honestly. I’ve really enjoyed it. The fan base is fierce and they care about their team and they want to see us do well. And when things are going great, it is one of the best places to be. I love the city in general, just the energy, the type of people that are here, the personalities that the people around here have, the personalities of our fans. I have really, really love playing here. Q: Coming out of Penn State, how did you feel about lasting until the fourth round of the 2024 draft? A: There’s definitely a chip on my shoulder for sure. That’s something I definitely think about, and think about the people drafted over me. I carry that with me every day. Q: You check their stats every day? A: No, no, no, not crazy like that. But I definitely look out for like, “What has he been doing?” stuff like that. Q: You thought you’d go second or third round? A: I had my draft party on Day 2 because I thought for sure that’s what it was going to be. Q: Are you a trash talker? A: I’m not someone that’s going to go out of my way to trash talk, but I definitely get into it for sure. Q: If someone talks to you … A: Yeah, and if I make a play I’m going to let somebody know, too. 5 Giants tight end Theo Johnson (84) celebrates his touchdown with New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart (6) during the second half when the New York Giants played the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, September 28, 2025. Robert Sabo for NY Post Q: If you bludgeoned me or caught a ball against me, what would you tell me? A: Like, “It’s going to be a long day for you.” Q: George Kittle has been someone you’ve admired. A: He’s definitely one of them. I looked at a lot of Gronk [Rob Gronkowski] stuff. Tony G. [Gonzalez], Jimmy G. [Graham]. I liked Kittle a lot like in college and stuff because I saw myself as a complete tight end that can do a little bit of everything. He was just as invested and willing in the run game as he was in the pass game. Q: What have you heard about Mark Bavaro? A: I’ve heard that he’s arguably probably the best tight end to play for the Giants, and he was a force. Q: Have you seen the clip of him dragging 49er defenders? A: I saw that, yeah. Q: What did you think when you watched it? A: Exactly what I said, that guy’s a force. Q: If you could go back in time and block any defender in NFL history, who would it be? A: I think I’d want to block Troy Polamalu. My first ever NFL jersey was him. And I think he’s a guy that played the game with ferocity and played like his hair was on fire. 5 Tight end Theo Johnson (84) makes a touchdown catch against New Orleans Saints cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry (4) in the first half. AP Q: What did you think of Penn State firing coach James Franklin? A: It’s a tough situation. I know all the guys and everyone in the building is kind of feeling that. You can say whatever about his record against ranked teams or whatever. He knew how to bring a group of individuals together and make a team. And everyone that’s ever come out of that building has a tremendous respect for him. He can be hard at you at times, like he cared about you not just as a player but as a person. Q: What did you eat at Emilios Ballato? A: (Laugh) What didn’t I eat? I think that’s a better question. We had a little bit of everything. I think my favorite thing was their veal parm was nuts. All the pastas really good, the chicken parm was good, the meatballs were good … one of the better veal parms I’ve had. Q: Three dinner guests? A: Michael Jackson, Denzel Washington, Drake. Q: Favorite movie? A: “Interstellar.” Q: Favorite actress? A: Growing up I loved Jennifer Lawrence. Q: Favorite meal? A: Lamb gyro. Q: What do you think of the Giants-Eagles rivalry? A: It goes back years … two fan bases that don’t really like each other very much. I know a lot about the Eagles and how their fans are kind of wild and rowdy and how our fans can be a little wild and rowdy. There’s probably a lot of unhappy people that we beat them a few weeks ago, so I think it should be a pretty cool environment. Q: How obsessed or desperate are you to help the Giants turn this around? A: Yeah, that’s all I think about every day, is what I can do, what my part is in the team winning. And when we lose, I always look at what did I do to contribute to the loss? Q: What is your message to Giants fans? A: We might not be where we want to be right now, but there’s a lot of get excited about. Q: How close is this team? A: Anyone watching the games knows how close we are. We’re a few plays away from having a complete different record. Q: What are you most proud of about where you are now in your life? A: I’m most proud of being a brother I’d say. I’ve worked to get to a position where I can help my family. 5 Theo Johnson of the New York Giants celebrates a touchdown. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post Q: Describe your mother, Amy. A: Selfless is probably the biggest word to describe her. Selfless and hard-working. She always put everyone else before herself, always put me and my brothers before her. She would have us eat and she wouldn’t eat. Always made sure that we were taken care of. And she is the hands down hardest-working person I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Watching her do what she did, and go through undergrad and law school with six kids … you can’t fathom how much work that took to maintain, like to keep six people alive, let alone have them turn out business owners, professional football players. … My one brother is studying in Germany doing a Master’s degree. … We didn’t just stay alive. But we were successful citizens in our field, in our countries, and I just think it’s amazing. Q: Her getting a Master’s after overcome domestic abuse, does that make you think you can overcome anything? A: She has always told me that, “If you want to do something, you can do it. But the only thing that’s ever going to stop you is yourself.” And, I’ve seen that to be true, because I was a kid that grew up in the middle of nowhere Canada, and now I’m playing for the Giants. And there’s not a single person that I played with growing up that’s in the NFL, or that even went Division I in college. I’ve had people, when I was growing up, tell me like, “Maybe you should have different goals.” Or, “Maybe you should be more realistic.” And my mom’s like, “Man, no. If you want something, if you want to do it, you got to put your heart into it, you got to give your all to it now. You can’t just say you want it and don’t do the work. But if you really want it, you can do it. There’s a way. You just have to be willing to do what it’s takes to get there.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Theo Johnson (@theo.johnson_) Q: How proud is she of you? A: I think she’s pretty proud of me, I’d like to say. Sometimes she’ll still cry when I see her before the games and stuff, which makes me feel really good because there’s a lot of times where she was crying and it was because I wasn’t listening or doing bad stuff. So it always feels good when I see how proud she is of me where I am. Q: What drives you? A: There’s two main things right now. First thing is wanting to support my family, and to be able to provide for them. Whatever anyone needs I want to be able to support them. The second thing is, I want to get every ounce of potential out of myself. I want to be the best I can possibly be, which I think is very, very good. And I don’t want to be laying on my death bed knowing, and thinking, that there was more there that I didn’t rise to. I didn’t accomplish.

In a tumultuous first season with the Tar Heels, he nearly produced a tangible sign of progress. But despite taking No. 16 Virginia to overtime and despite an aggressive call for a two-point conversion that could’ve won the game, the Cavaliers stopped running back Benjamin Hall just inches from the goal line to escape with a 17-16 victory in Chapel Hill on Saturday. 4 Bill Belichick reacts on the sideline during UNC’s Oct. 25, 2025 game.

Instead, his gutsy call ended in heartbreak. “Trying to win the game,” Belichick told reporters of his decision. “I don’t know what else you want me to tell you.” Virginia possessed the ball first in overtime, converted a key third-and-7 to extend the drive and eventually scored when J’Mari Taylor scored from one yard out.

That’s when Belichick took one of his biggest on-field risks since landing the UNC job, keeping the offense on the field instead of kicking the extra point to tie the game and forcing another round of drives in overtime. It marked a second consecutive crushing loss for the Tar Heels after Nathan Leacock fumbled near the goal line last week and cost UNC a potential go-ahead touchdown in their three-point loss to Cal. 4 Davion Gause runs after a catch for North Carolina during its overtime loss to Virginia on Oct. 25.

Getty Images And it would’ve added a brief moment of stability for a North Carolina program that has encountered anything but that since hiring Belichick — with the legendary NFL coach and his girlfriend, Jordan Hudson, generating plenty of off-field storylines. There was the scene of Kenan Memorial Stadium starting to empty before halftime during a blowout loss to Clemson. There was the scene last week at Cal, too, when the Bears mocked the Tar Heels on the videoboard with a pair of fake statements — a jab at the ones UNC needed to release last week amid reports of “potential exit strategy discussions” already taking place. 4 Bill Belichick reacts before UNC’s Oct. 25 game. Bob Donnan-Imagn Images “Coach Belichick has the full support of the Department of Athletics and University,” director of athletics Bubba Cunningham said in the statement, while the 73-year-old Belichick said that he’s also “fully committed to UNC Football and the program we’re building there.” Just weeks later, he nearly had a breakthrough. It wouldn’t have meant that the Tar Heels would go on to make a bowl game. They haven’t resembled anything close to the potential national contender they were supposed to be under Belichick, either. But it would’ve been a start, and instead, the Tar Heels dropped to 2-5 and remain winless in Atlantic Coast Conference play entering a game against Syracuse on Friday.

Matvei Michkov’s shootout winner capped a comeback win for the Flyers and sent the Islanders on to Boston with a bitter taste, having leads of 2-0 and 3-2 before falling 4-3 to Philadelphia on Saturday at Xfinity Mobile Arena. The Islanders and Flyers alike played a disjointed, daytime hockey game as if they’d had their Halloween parties the night before, and it was clear from the start that whoever made the fewest mistakes would end up on top. 6 New York Islanders goaltender Ilya Sorokin is unable to make a save on a goal scored by Philadelphia Flyers’ Christian Dvorak (22) during the second period of an NHL hockey game, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. AP “I didn’t think either team played great,” Tony DeAngelo said. “Thought we needed to generate more sustained [offensive zone] time. … I didn’t think they had O-zone time either. It was more of a neutral-zone game.” Despite what was far from their best performance, it looked for much of the game like the Islanders would get over the finish line. Their bottom six — which seems to fit together much easier with Simon Holmstrom on the third line and Kyle MacLean on the fourth, though that comes with Max Shabanov missing time due to injury — looked ready to carry the day, and all 18 skaters were contributing physicality to the mix.

Warren, who became the third native Long Islander to suit up for the Isles, and whose childhood picture in orange Islanders gear floated around the internet on Friday after the team announced he would play, appeared on the brink of completing a dream debut when he recorded his second assist of the afternoon early in the third period.

Check out more newsletters That blast from the top of the zone, tipped in by Max Tsyplakov, gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead which may have been decisive. That wouldn’t be the end of it, though, not with emotions boiling over and both teams freely taking penalties — the Islanders, in part, to try and protect rookie Matthew Schaefer, who was targeted all afternoon by the Flyers. When Scott Mayfield was called for high sticking and went to the box for the third time on the day, though, the Flyers finally took advantage, with Noah Cates stuffing the puck in on a scramble in the crease. The Islanders had plenty of chances to break the 3-3 deadlock from there, in particular Bo Horvat’s overtime look off Jonathan Drouin’s cross-ice feed. Samuel Ersson, though, got over in time to rob Horvat with his glove and keep the game alive. 6 Trevor Zegras of the Philadelphia Flyers celebrates his game-tying power-play goal against the New York Islanders.

Kyle Ross-Imagn Images “I thought we won the game when Drouin made that pass to Horvat,” Islanders coach Patrick Roy said, and so did the 16,640 in attendance. “That was a really good save.” Ersson ended up bettering Ilya Sorokin in the shootout, too, denying Anthony Duclair to end the game after Michkov had scored the second Flyers goal in the skills competition. Sorokin, in his first start since Sergei Naumovs was made Islanders goaltending coach, looked technically sound throughout the afternoon, though his rebound control was shaky at points. He finished with 23 saves, but stopped just one of three in the shootout. 6 New York Islanders’ Anthony Duclair, right, celebrates his goal with Marshall Warren during the second period.

On Saturday, it was not. “When you’re down a couple goals at the end there, you always turn it on,” said Holmstrom, who scored for the second straight game, this one short-handed. “You gotta be ready for the push, kill off the [Mayfield penalty] as well.

The actor, 17, explained what it was like to portray characters with a strained relationship opposite his real life dad, Matthew McConaughey, in the “Lost Bus.” “Just the confidence of our relationship outside the movie, because in the movie, it’s not a good relationship,” Levi told People on October 18. “But to be able to do it and then come out of the scene, and give each other a hug and go, ‘Thank you. Thank God that that’s not how our relationship is in real life.’ It just made it easier and fun.” 6 Levi McConaughey attending the screening of the movie “The Lost Bus.” Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/Shutterstock Along with the teen, Matthew, 55, and wife Camila Alves, 42, also share kids Vida, 15, and Livingston, 12.

Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/Shutterstock The movie is based on true events from the 2018 Camp Fire in the town of Paradise. The blaze still remains one of the deadliest in California’s history. Jamie Lee Curtis serves as a producer, while the rest of the star-studded lineup included America Ferrera, Yul Vazquez, Ashlie Atkinson and Spencer Watson. Matthew previously opened up about the tips he gave his first born ahead of career in Hollywood. “I’ve tried to give him some tips that I’ve learned along the way, tried to give him some of those tips earlier than I understood them,” the actor told People in September. “I really got into the public eye when I was about 23 or 24 with ‘A Time to Kill.’ It was a lot: boom! All of a sudden, the world was a mirror. I didn’t meet any strangers or expectations and ‘I love yous’ all around.” Matthew confessed that it could be “hard to keep your feet on the ground to sift out the real stuff from the BS.” 6 Matthew McConaughey, Camila Alves, Kay McConaughey and Levi McConaughey attend the Toronto International Film Festival.

AFP via Getty Images “But over time, you got to get that sixth sense,” he continued before adding of Levi, “it’s important that he has his own ownership of who he is and becomes. And [acting] will be a part of that if he continues to do it, part of finding his identity. But it can’t be his full identity.” Levi did admit that he does feel the heat of being Matthew’s son. “Yeah, it’s just starting,” he told the outlet. “And as much as people can say, ‘Oh, you got this because of your father or your mother,’ they can open the door, but then it’s going to be up to me to do my thing once I get in there. That’s on me.“ 6 Camila Alves McConaughey, Matthew McConaughey and Levi Alves McConaughey.

That wasn’t enough to make me say ‘maybe’ or anything.” 6 The McConaughey family. FilmMagic Levi was persistent and continued to ask his dad about the role. Matthew explained, “He came back four more times and I said, ‘Okay, now he’s working for it, for the idea.’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ I knew they hadn’t cast the part. Pulled out the camera, worked with him on a scene, and sent that to [casting director] Francine Maisler, and I said — remember I had a note? — I said, ‘I think it might be good enough for a callback.’ And she wrote back, ‘I think it might be good enough to show to Paul [Greengrass].’” Filed under celebrity children celebrity families matthew mcconaughey 10/25/25 Read Next Johnny Depp recalls Tim Burton making \u0027huge sacrifices\u0027 fo...

Others came to the man’s defence, however, and argued that it was possible that the beauty products belonged to an ex. In the comments section beneath the video, Lauren declared that she eventually confronted the man, who claimed that the items were his sister’s. She shared a follow-up video revealing that she left the man’s home after refusing to buy his story.

Splitter, 40 and a seven-year NBA veteran, took over as Portland’s interim head coach after Chauncey Billups was arrested Thursday over his alleged role in an illegal poker scheme — the same day that Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player Damon Jones were also arrested for their alleged roles in separate poker and illegal sports gambling rings. The mood at the facility was “not great” on Thursday, Splitter told reporters pregame, but when the Trail Blazers needed to return to basketball and escape the chaos of the situation for at least one night, Splitter guided them to a 139-119 victory. 4 Tiago Splitter coaches from the sideline during the Trail Blazers’ Oct. 24 win.

Both of those teams are ranked inside the top 10, so the Tigers are still alive in their bid for a spot in the College Football Playoff, but they’ll need to win out and get some help. A victory against the Aggies would be a massive first step towards LSU saving its season. 21+. Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER. AZ, CO, DC, IA, IN, KS, KY, MA, MD, MI, NC, NJ, PA, TN, WV, WY.

The Bayou Bengals are 5-2 after bookending a win over South Carolina with losses to Ole Miss and Vanderbilt, meaning they need to run the table if they have a prayer of getting into the College Football Playoff. That task starts with beating Texas A\u0026M in Death Valley on Saturday night.

What’s making it a particularly bitter pill to swallow is that the defense, the projected weakness of this team going into Week 1, has held up its end of the bargain. The offense, led by preseason Heisman-favorite Garrett Nussmeier, has not. Garrett Nussmeier of LSU.

Perhaps if Nussmeier carries that form into Saturday night, the Tigers have a shot.

LSU’s defense grades out as No. 6 in the country per SP+, but they had issues slowing down another talismanic quarterback, Diego Pavia, last week, and with the offense sputtering, there is no margin for error for Blake Baker’s unit.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC, claims Cynthia Concordia is on the hook for the cash lost by Signature Bank in the long-running scheme, so infamous, Hulu aired a documentary about it. But Concordia, 64, who’s been fighting off the feds for two years, said she’s as much a victim as anyone else. 6 The FDIC wants Virginia grandmother Cynthia Concordia to pay $378,000 — but the former World Bank analyst said she’s as much a victim of the scam as anyone else. Andrew Thomas – CNP for NY Post “I was so gullible,” the single mother of two lamented to The Post. In November 2019, the retired World Bank analyst received a message from a stranger on LinkedIn using the name Mason Brown Thuthill who claimed to work for Blockchain, a popular cryptocurrency platform.

At the time, she was struggling to pay off her son’s roughly $20,000 annual college tuition to the Culinary Institute of America in the Hudson Valley and thinking of the future. “I just wanted to make sure that they have enough when I die,” Concordia said. “It’s not for me. It’s for my children, it’s for my family.” Eventually she caved, handing over $700 to the stranger, who had changed his name to Brian Haugen. 6 Hulu Haugen, an actor from Los Angeles, is also a victim, with thousands of thieves stealing his image and hiding behind it in online profiles to target older women in an ongoing romance scam, according to court papers.

The two would pray together, she recalled. “I have struggled with you because two things. I love you and the earnest desire for you is to see you succeed and be happy,” the scammer told her, according to court papers. 6 The scam using Haugen’s face is so prolific, ABC News Studios did a three-part documentary on it. Hulu When Concordia pushed for a video or in-person meeting, he put her off. “Cynthia, I can’t be seen having an affair with clients. It’s against company policy. That’s why I told you after the whole investment, then I can be with you,” he said, according to a deposition. She eventually forked over $47,000 of her own cash to the scammer, and allegedly accepted massive wire transfers and bought bitcoin at his direction. She didn’t get wise to the illicit plot until July 2021, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation called. 6 Haugen works as an actor, model and spokesperson. Hulu 6 Photos of Haugen have been stolen thousands of times by scammers who have swindled big bucks from unwitting victims. Hulu 6 Haugen participated in the “Hey Beautiful” documentary, which is streaming on Hulu. Hulu “I think I’m the only one that was left. They couldn’t go after the scammer,” she said of the FDIC lawsuit, insisting she never spent a penny of the ill-gotten gains — and noting her scammer is in the wind. “I’m not sure going after a naive grandmother who is a victim herself is really what the FDIC is for, but we will see how this all plays out,” said Concordia’s lawyer, James DeCristofaro, who filed court papers Friday in a bid to toss the case.

Two pro basketball players were named by prosecutors in the sprawling poker case, which alleges that fraudsters and mobsters allegedly fixed big-money games using sophisticated cheating tech like rigged X-ray card tables, crooked card shufflers, and special glasses and contact lenses that could spy marked cards, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday in Brooklyn federal court. Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and former NBA player Damon Jones were named. The fixers called their deep-pocketed victims “fish,” while the high-profile athletes who lured them to the tables were called “face cards.” 4 Chauncey Billups, left, was allegedly paid as a “face card” to attract big money players. Obtained by NYPost The anonymous fish could not say if his fleecing was part of the same poker ring probed by the feds — but he did finger at least one man involved in both. He said Curtis Meeks of Texas — who was named in the Thursday indictment as a major supplier of the cheating machines to the scammers — was a main participant in the rigged game that bilked him and his buddies out of nearly $1 million in a single night.

I’ve since found out that what he’s done to us, he’s done to many other people. This was not a freak occurrence,” the alleged victim said. Prosecutors did not go into great detail regarding Meeks. According to a gambling world insider, “Meeks supposedly was an amateur boxer. He went around telling people that he’s a jeweler. That was his schtick.” 4 The victim described Curtis Meeks as “the most despicable human I’ve ever been around in my entire life.” Williamson County Sheriff\u0027s Office He and 30 others were arrested in connection to the massive poker ring, an indictment that also named a slew of mob associates who have previously made headlines — including Thomas “Tommy Juice” Gelardo, who allegedly collected gambling debts with threats and intimidation; and Nicholas “Fat Nick” Minucci, a Gambino crime family associate who was convicted of beating a black kid with a baseball bat while shouting the N-word in 2005. An attorney for Meeks was not listed, and his family could not be reached for comment. On the night Meeks allegedly took the Post source for a ride, he used a retired NFL athlete to lure the group into a situation they realized was sketchy from the get-go, but it wasn’t until they were in the midst of the game did they realize they were being scammed. The professional jock was to join a game planned at a public location, but the venue was suddenly changed to his high-rise apartment, the man said. 4 The group allegedly used rigged X-ray card tables, card shufflers and special glasses and contact lenses. US Attorney / EDNY There was a series of other red flags, the alleged victim said, including that once inside the apartment, the host raised the buy-in from $10,000 to $20,000 — meaning the victims would lose more money faster. They didn’t exchange cash to get in the game, but were given chips on a credit basis — payable afterwards. And all the winning hands went “to the four guys who were in on the scam,” he claimed. “Those guys cheated with a device, and they cheated me and cheated other people who were good people. And they used a star athlete. They used the star to do it. They had us excited. The only reason they were able to pull this off was because they had a professional athlete in place,” the source said. “We knew that it was a device because of how they would push. It wasn’t like a thing where they could see the backs of cards. It was like, let’s go all in before any cards even come out.” One of the man’s friends recognized the scam and called out the group before leaving the apartment, but the mobsters followed up with weeks and weeks of relentless demands that they pay up. “They wouldn’t let up in trying to get their money. It got scarier and scarier. Serious threats were made. Ultimately, we just agreed to pay them,” the victim explained. The incident closely resembles the plot laid out by federal prosecutors this month, though the 31-defendant indictment does not mention any NFL players or athletes from other sports leagues. Neither the NFL nor the Eastern District of New York immediately responded to The Post’s request for comment. A second NBA-related indictment this week involves an illegal sports gambling ring that placed bets on games using insider information about the Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors, Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers and their players. While the poker scam cost the victim and his friends nearly $1 million, the man says the real price was his “trust for the game.” “Moving forward is the real punishment. Because there’s a paranoia now. There’s a constant turn in my mind: Something is happening. Considering how sophisticated AI has been and how sophisticated they are, that’s scary to me. I’ve been around so long, playing poker, and I am fine with losing, but I have no tolerance for cheating,” he said.

Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn), but it’s also backed far lefties like ex-NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Sherrill had 50% to 45% lead over Jack Ciattarelli in a Rutgers-Eagleton poll of likely voters released Thursday, but it’s a far cry from the 20-point lead she held in June.

Our “Ugly Underdog” column stayed hot thanks to Michigan State’s ho-hum cover against Indiana in Week 8. Trailing, 35-10, after the third quarter, Sparty and the Hoosiers both elected to put the game into neutral with a 3-3 fourth stanza. We’ll take it and move on to Week 9, where we look to run our record to 7-2 with a fade of The U. Let’s go back 11 months. The Miami Hurricanes were undefeated with a Heisman-caliber quarterback leading the charge. Nobody in the ACC seemed close to the Hurricanes, who were 9-0 and set to march into the College Football Playoff thanks to a light schedule that saw them face Georgia Tech, Wake Forest and Syracuse to close out the campaign.

Syracuse was all that stood in the way of the Hurricanes and a trip to the ACC Championship, where they’d face SMU. We know how this ends. Miami blew a 21-0 lead to the Orange, wrecking a once-promising season, and putting some heat on head coach Mario Cristobal, who already had a reputation for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. To their credit, Cristobal and Miami didn’t seem to carry any demons into the new season. Carson Beck slotted in brilliantly for Cam Ward at quarterback, and Miami boasted NFL-ready players all over the field. The Hurricanes handled Notre Dame, South Florida, Florida and Florida State, earning the right to be ranked No. 2 in the country heading into a Friday night showdown with Louisville. Stanford head coach Frank Reich. Darren Yamashita-Imagn Images Miami got caught by the Cardinals, ending its five-game win streak and putting their postseason aspirations, be it in the ACC or College Football Playoff, in serious jeopardy. The pressure will be on the Hurricanes from here on out as they look to quell any fears that Cristobal has them up to their old tricks. Betting on College Football?

Or is it? The Cardinal were projected to be terrible in 2025, with most pundits picking them to foot the table in the ACC. See Also College football Week 9 predictions: Picks against the spread A loss to Hawaii in Week 0 had plenty of college football folk talking about a potential winless campaign. Hard to blame them. But Frank Reich, yes, that Frank Reich, has Stanford relishing the spoiler role. The Cardinal have turned themselves into a respectable outfit over night, scratching out wins over Boston College, San Jose State and Florida State. There were some drubbings against BYU and Virginia mixed into that mix, but the point is that this team is much vexatious than anybody thought they would be in Year 1 under Reich. Stanford has plenty of wind in its sails as it heads to South Beach, where Miami is waiting as 30.5-point favorites. And while Stanford will look at this game like its very own Super Bowl, it is a classic lookahead spot for the Hurricanes. Miami knows that it can beat Stanford without getting out of first gear, and they may opt to stay there in order to be fresh for what’s to come on the other side of this weekend. A trip to SMU in Week 10 and then a chance to exact revenge on Syracuse seven days later. Cristobal has an awful habit of squandering these opportunities, and while it’s outlandish to think Stanford can come away with a win, or even keep this one close, the Cardinal can absolutely stick within 30 points of the Hurricanes, who are likely to ease off the pedal in the latter stages of this contest.

The actor, 62, recalled how the filmmaker, 67, made accommodations for him to continue filming “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” in 2007 despite his daughter’s illness. At the time, Lily-Rose Depp was 7 years old and had developed a form of kidney failure. 7 Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton attend the european premiere of “Dark Shadows.” Getty Images “Tim made huge sacrifices on Sweeney,” Depp recounted in the new four-part docuseries “Tim Burton: Life in the Line.” In the third episode, the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star said he considers Burton “a part of my family.” Explore More TikTok star shared final post 2 days before shocking suicide at 19 Paris Jackson makes startling claim against father Michael\u0027s estate, dividing her family Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s friend reveals which of the star\u0027s 7 husbands was best in bed 7 Jamie Campbell Bower and Johnny Depp in “Sweeney Todd.” ©DreamWorks/Courtesy Everett Collection The director worked with Depp in “Edward Scissorhands” in 1990, “Ed Wood” in 1994, 1999’s “Sleepy Hollow,” and 2005’s “Corpse Bride” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” The producer, who shares Lily-Rose, 26, and son Jack, 23, with ex Vanessa Paradis, explained that his daughter’s “kidneys were shutting down.” “She had contracted E. coli. They put her on dialysis, and I had to call Tim and basically say, ‘Hey man, I’m going to have to drop out of Sweeney. I’m sorry, but I can’t work until my baby’s better,’ ” Depp continued in the doc. “And [Burton] went ‘No. Don’t even talk like that, man. Whatever we have to do, we’ll do. She’s going to be fine. We’ll make it work.’ ” 7 Johnny Depp in the 2007 musical/horror film. ©DreamWorks/Courtesy Everett Collection The Golden Globe winner said that he and Paradis, 52, “lived in that hospital for a good three, three and-a-half weeks.” “Tim, of course, being Tim, came by the day after I called and brought flowers, the great uncle and godfather that he is,” Deep added. “Pretty special, very lucky.” Derek Frey, a producer on the film, recalled that “Sweeney Todd” “shut down for a couple of weeks” while Depp was with his family. 7 Johnny Depp and Lily Rose Melody Depp arrive at Narita International Airport on July 16, 2013. WireImage “We’re exploring some dark themes in that film, really tough stuff, and here’s a character who is introspective and fighting demons and drawn to spill blood and seeking vengeance,” Frey, 52, explained. “And then [Depp is] going through this really dark, heavy real thing going on in his personal life. So that definitely, at least for a time, shaded a little bit of the production. My assessment is that there’s points in that movie where you’re seeing real emotion come through, like he’s channeling what he’s going through personally.” Lily-Rose ended up recovering and following in her dad’s footsteps. 7 Johnny Depp pushing his child in the stroller. UK Press via Getty Images In January, the “Nosferatu” star touched on working on supernatural films just like her father. “I guess you could say so,” she told Harper’s Bazaar of her interest. “We’re very different actors, but of course you’re the product of your environment, and it’s a world I’ve always been very interested in.” “I’m interested in the darker underbelly of things. As an actor, you hope that your role will be as meaty as can be, so you have as much to dive into as possible,” Lily-Rose continued. “The most exciting thing is getting to explore parts of myself.” 7 Lily-Rose Depp, Johnny Depp, and Amber Heard in 2016. David X Prutting/BFA/Shutterstock “You get to hide behind all these beautiful artifices, the costumes, the story, but the place I’m drawing from is deeply personal,” the “Idol” alum added. During the interview, Lily-Rose also revealed that she watched her dad’s movies as a child, but one in particular has stuck with her for years — the hit classic “Edward Scissorhands.” “I was traumatized by it,” she confessed. “Not because I thought he was scary, but because everyone was being so mean to him and I got really upset.” 7 Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. Getty Images Speaking about her upbringing in a 2023 interview, the actress also credited her parents with doing their best to ensure she and her brother had a “normal” childhood. “Obviously, still not totally normal, but a sense of normalcy at least, and a sense of childhood and freedom and play and everything,” she expressed at the time.

But his representation is saying otherwise. The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reported Saturday that representatives for the Longhorns head coach “have let NFL decision makers know that he would be interested in potential head coaching openings.” The Titans, who have a head coach opening after firing Brian Callahan earlier this month, were named specifically by Russini. However, hours after The Athletic’s report, Sarkisian’s agents at Creative Artists Agency put out a statement, denying that the coach has any thoughts of making a jump to the pros. “Any reports regarding communications on coaching opportunities with NFL teams are patently false and wildly inaccurate. Sark is solely focused on coaching the University of Texas football team,” wrote Jimmy Sexton and Ed Marynowitz. Sarkisian is no stranger to the NFL.

Earlier this year, Sarkisian got a new deal from Texas that extended his contract through the 2031 season and raised his salary this year from $10.4 million to $10.8 million. At the time, Sarkisian had reportedly declined interviews with two NFL teams and did not formally meet with any team to stay in Texas. “The fact Sarkisian didn’t take any NFL interviews shows his buy-in and commitment to the University of Texas,” a source told the Action Network in January.

The subterranean city, called Festungsfront Oder-Warthe-Bogen, or the Ostwall, located in the serene countryside around the small Polish village of Pniewo, was abandoned in 1945. It is now a dark tourism destination, with 19 miles of eerie tunnels open for people to explore in the Międzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum. 3 The Międzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum recreated what life underground looked like.

The museum recreated the tunnels to show what life underground for members of the Third Reich looked like — with mannequins in uniform standing guard in administrative rooms, sleeping areas and bathrooms. The museum opened in 2011. 3 The 20-mile complex consists of tunnels, shafts, underground railway stations and combat facilities. The Miedzyrzecz Fortified Region Museum Construction on the Ostwall began before World War II as Adolf Hitler hoped to fortify Germany’s eastern frontier from Poland and the Soviet Union. Originally, the plans were for it stretch 50 miles, with work on the ambitious project scheduled until 1951. However, by 1938, Germany refocused on France, and halted the Ostwall’s construction. 3 In the ’80s and ’90s, the tunnels became the site of raves and weddings hosted by the counter-cultural subculture the Bunker People. AFP via Getty Images The following year, the invasion of Poland triggered World War II and the project was scrapped. Although it was never completed, it is considered one the most advanced fortifications in the world, with its central section alone able to hold tens of thousands of soldiers.

When discussing College Football Playoff odds for undefeated and one-loss teams — everyone with at least a 2 percent chance, according to the graphic — with the rest of the ESPN panel, McAfee, who hosts his eponymous show during the week, made a joke about Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, who was arrested Thursday after allegedly being one of the “face cards” in a high-stakes poker scheme that was rigged. “Not a lot of people are betting on two percent chances unless you’re Chauncey Billups at a Chauncey Billups poker game,” McAfee said from the show’s set in Nashville ahead of the Vanderbilt-Missouri game. “He was making some big bets allegedly on things that were just not likely, and everybody kind of knew they were rigged games.” Pat McAfee drops a Chauncey Billups joke on College GameDay. https://t.co/Cxk2IVIOEG pic.twitter.com/kvk19u5b1N — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 25, 2025 Pat McAfee is pictured during “College GameDay” on Oct. 25.

Billups, who the Trail Blazers placed on leave following his arrest, was allegedly part of the ring with connections to the Mafia that used X-ray card tables, special glasses, special contact lenses and card shuffles to fix the poker games.

He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.” But it has also left the Trail Blazers without their head coach just games into the season, as interim head coach Tiago Splitter coached the team for their win against the Warriors on Friday.

Bernstein did the interviewing, while Feinberg and Lee filmed the encounters and posted them online. About half the time, they were turned down, but the other half of the time yielded wonderfully relatable and hopeful content. Their initiative, Meet Cutes, quickly went viral, amassing 3 million followers on Instagram and 1.9 million on TikTok. Now, the trio have turned the phenomenon into a book, “Meet Cutes NYC: True Stories of Love and Connection” (Artisan Books, out now). 6 Jeremy Bernstein (from left), Victor Lee and Aaron Feinberg are the romantics behind “Meet Cutes.” Photographs by Jeremy Cohen 6 The “Meet Cutes” book is out now. From more than 5,000 videos, Feinberg, Bernstein and Lee selected a diverse mix of 85 couples of all ages and backgrounds for the book.

Alice \u0026 Geoffrey 6 Alice and Geoffrey’s story is one of the all-time favorites, according to the “Meet Cutes” creators. Photographs by Jeremy Cohen The two first met decades ago while working at Channel 13 — she was an assistant on “American Family,” and he was a mail clerk. Every week, Geoffrey delivered the stacks of fashion magazines Alice ordered to her office. One day, he overheard her on the phone saying dramatically, “Oh, darling, I was just in Morocco. The death in Morocco, darling,” and he couldn’t resist mocking her. Alice caught him and shouted, “Who the hell do you think you are?” Later, when she had an extra ticket to a popular late-night show, she invited Geoffrey along. Afterward, they walked 46 blocks home, talking the entire way — and they haven’t stopped since. “Alice and Geoffrey’s story is one of our all-time favorites,” Feinberg told The Post. “It’s sharp, unexpected and completely unforgettable. It’s proof that love doesn’t always start with sparks. Sometimes it starts with sarcasm and a mail cart.” Mike \u0026 Karen 6 Mike and Karen’s story has resonated with fans because “it’s about second chances,” Feinberg said. Photographs by Jeremy Cohen The pair met in a college lecture hall. Mike secretly wished Karen would sit next to him — she did. He asked her out, only to learn she had a boyfriend. Years later, she was single and they started dating. But after a couple years together, they broke up because Mike wasn’t ready. Then, two years after that, they ran into each crossing a street and have been together ever since. “Their video is one of our five most popular,” Lee told The Post. “Their story resonated so deeply because it’s about second chances, the kind of imperfect, full-circle love that feels both cinematic and real,” Feinberg added. “Timing matters and love doesn’t always unfold in a straight line.” Thuy \u0026 San 6 Thuy and San climbed their way to love. Photographs by Jeremy Cohen Thuy and San were wearing matching hoodies when Feinberg, Lee, and Bernstein saw them in Clinton Hill on a grocery run. The pair met at a NYC climbing gym while Thuy was visiting from San Francisco. “San followed her up the wall, they chatted, and that was that, or so it seemed,” Lee said. “A few months later, Thuy moved to New York, and once again, she ran into San at a climbing gym. This time, San knew it was fate.” Thuy and San were wearing matching hoodies when Feinberg, Lee and Bernstein saw them in Clinton Hill on a grocery run.

This time, San knew it was fate.” Joe \u0026 Liza 6 Joe \u0026 Liza had new couple energy, even though they’d been together for years. Photographs by Jeremy Cohen Feinberg saw them in Williamsburg one day when he was by himself and was struck by how affectionate they were. “I thought they were a new couple, but they had been together 15 years,” he said. The pair met when Liza walked into Joe’s hardware store with her boyfriend. “Joe immediately thought, I hope I meet someone like her someday. Turns out, it wasn’t someone like her, it was her,” Feinberg told The Post. “Liza wasn’t happy in her relationship, and eventually made a change. The connection she felt with Joe was undeniable, and they’ve been together ever since.” Filed under books dating advice new york city PostScript 10/25/25 Read Next I\u0027m paying my daughters $35K to call off the wedding — h...

Fallen star in talks for first major studio film in years By Johnny Oleksinski Published Oct. 25, 2025, 1:36 p.m. ET Can Johnny really emerge from the Depps? That’s what everybody was asking this week when it was reported that tarnished actor Johnny Depp is in final negotiations to star in Paramount’s new “Christmas Carol” film as Ebeneezer Scrooge, a bitter old crank. Well, you’ve gotta admit the casting is bang-on. 4 Johnny Depp is reportedly in final negotiations to star in “A Christmas Carol” for Paramount. WireImage The job would mark Depp’s first major studio movie in seven years — an unforgiving eternity in Hollywood. A significant chunk of teens probably have no idea who this guy is. Depp’s last big gig was “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the second chapter of Warner Bros.’ lame “Harry Potter” spin-off series that he was unceremoniously fired from after he lost a 2020 libel case against Britain’s Sun newspaper, which called him a “wife-beater” in a story. Explore More Johnny Depp recalls Tim Burton making ‘huge sacrifices’ for him when daughter Lily-Rose got sick during ‘Sweeney Todd’ Charlize Theron appears to ignore former co-star Johnny Depp at Paris Fashion Week in awkward video Keira Knightley makes hilarious admission about her ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ role That blow came after ex-wife Amber Heard accused Depp in a Washington Post op-ed of abusing her. Depp denied it. But the drama wasn’t over yet. Then in 2022, his dirty-laundry-airing US defamation trial against Heard began. And it was oh so loudly heard ‘round the world. Remember that train wreck? What a spectacle it was. The trial included arguments of who was responsible for the alleged feces in the marital bed (Heard or Boo the dog?); Heard’s nickname “The Monster” for her husband’s allegedly violent alter-ego; and the “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!!” string of texts Depp allegedly sent actor Paul Bettany. And that’s just a small sprinkle of lowlights that unfolded over seven eventful weeks. 4 Although Depp won his defamation case against Amber Heard, his career hasn’t recovered. Getty Images Depp ultimately won his case. But nobody came off spotless, and the Court of Public Opinion rages on. That’s the only thing that matters. Is there, three years later, a significant appetite to see Johnny Depp in movies? I thought the man would never work again outside of French indie films, his hilariously egotistical Manhattan art show and, perhaps, selling crepes in France. What was left for him in showbiz but crumbs? The “Fantastic Beasts” series, which is donezo, replaced him with Mads Mikkelsen. “F–k you,” he said to a Telegraph reporter this summer when asked about it. Depp is too damaged now even for Keith Richards-inspired Captain Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise. He’s finished at Disney no matter what. The doors of the Magic Kingdom have been slammed shut. 4 Depp was riding high when he played Captain Jack Sparrow in “The Pirates of the Caribbean.” ©Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection Scandalous headlines aside, his type has also totally changed. Once a Hollywood bad boy, now he’s a bad AARP member. His sex appeal has vanished, which is not true of his fellow sixty-somethings Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. And the youthful angst that made him famous has turned acrid with age. He’s quite frankly off-putting. And then this Dickensian detour so intriguingly arrived. There is an important factor working in the actor’s favor here. The new movie called “Ebeneezer: A Christmas Carol” is not going to be a nice, family-friendly, yuletide version of the Victorian Era classic. It will be something of a horror film — “a ghost story,” according to Deadline — from “X” series director Ti West. As we’ve seen the last couple years with “Longlegs” ($128 million), “Sinners” ($367 million), “Weapons” ($267 million) and “The Conjuring: The Last Rites” ($485 million), horror still packs ‘em in, regardless of what star’s name is slapped on the poster. It’s a much safer bet than coming back in a prestige picture for serious adults. 4 The actor is right at home in macabre movies such as “Edward Scissorhands.” ©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection And the genre is comfy territory for Depp. He got his start in one, “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” and has been at home with the macabre ever since: “Sleepy Hollow,” “Sweeney Todd” and “The Corpse Bride,” just to name a few. So, assuming the contracts get signed, he’ll be playing a rude, “Bah humbug!”-spewing, spiteful geezer in a fright-tinged picture. Sounds about right.

Fourteen years after her death in 2011 at the age of 79, Vicky Tiel is sharing some insight into the late star’s romantic life. “We talked about sex all the time,” the fashion designer, 82, told People, revealing that Taylor’s favorite partner in bed “was Richard (Burton). Absolutely. No question about it. Her lover for life was Richard.” 6 Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton on the film set of “The Sandpiper” in 1965. Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images “She was very fun,” continued Tiel. “She took sex very lightly. She taught me a lot too; if something bad happens, you just roll your eyes, smile and don’t worry about it. She would just always laugh and be happy. She was a very, very happy person.” Taylor was married to Burton, who died in 1984 at the age of 58 after a brain hemorrhage, from 1964 to 1974. The two divorced before remarrying for a year in 1975.

Bettmann Archive “Before Richard died, I think two days before, he called me up,” she reminisced. “He said, ‘I don’t think I’m going to live very long, and I just wanted you and Ron [Tiel’s then husband, makeup artist Ron Berkeley] to tell Elizabeth I’ll always love her the most. I love her forever and ever. And I miss her and I love her with all my heart.’ “ Shortly after when Tiel stopped by Taylor’s Bel Air home, she realized the starlet felt the same. “She’s taking a bath,” the couture designer shared. “She said, ‘Well, come on in the bathtub.’ So I go in the bathroom. She’s got a bathtub, and all the way around is a ledge around her bathtub. It’s all frames of diamond edges; not real, but I mean, gorgeous frames, maybe 20 frames surrounding the bathtub. It was all pictures of her and Richard.” Tiel and Taylor first met in Paris in 1964. The film star was looking to change up her wardrobe from ’50s wear to something more chic. 6 Elizabeth Taylor with her husband, British actor Michael Wilding. Getty Images “She threw away the old clothes, the Dior look and the fitted suits,” recalled Tiel. “It was so ‘old lady.’ We were now in the ’60s, the sexual revolution. Elizabeth loved that. From then on she always wore my mini dresses.” The pals traveled all over Europe together for various movies in the late ’60s and early ’70s. These days, Taylor is still as relevant as ever. The docuseries “Elizabeth Taylor: Rebel Superstar,” executive-produced by Kim Kardashian, is now streaming on Fox Nation. Taylor Swift also has a song called “Elizabeth Taylor” on her recent “Life of a Showgirl” album. Taylor’s son Christopher Wilding told People: “She and my mom do seem like kindred spirits. They are both the very embodiment of female empowerment.” All of which is no surprise to Tiel. “She was the most famous woman on planet Earth,” the fashionista mused. Taylor, meanwhile, was married seven times over her life. Along with tying the knot twice with Burton, she also married Conrad Hilton Jr. from 1950 to 1951; Michael Wilding from 1952 to 1957; Mike Todd from 1957 to 1958; Eddie Fisher from 1959 to 1964; John W. Warner from 1976 to 1982; and Larry Fortensky from 1991 to 1996. 6 Elizabeth Taylor with her husband, producer Mike Todd at the film premiere of “Around the World in 80 Days”, Cannes, France, May 6 1957.

In the 2024 doc, “Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes,” there were some never-before-heard audio recordings of the “Cleopatra” actress sharing her honest feelings about her seven husbands. She had said that Hilton Jr. abused her while she was pregnant, and that Wilding wasn’t dominant enough for the pair to survive, per People. But when it came to the ex of Debbie Reynolds and father of “Star Wars” actress Carrie Fisher, Taylor revealed that she “never loved Eddie.” 6 Elizabeth Taylor, and her husband, John Warner. Bettmann Archive The exes had an affair while Fisher, was still with Reynolds. “I liked him. I felt sorry for him. And I liked talking to him,” she admitted. “But he was not Mike.” Todd was Taylor’s third husband, who died in a plane crash in 1958. “I was keeping Mike alive by talking about him. Because Eddie, he was a great fried of Mike’s,” she shared in the doc. “That was the only thing we had in common, was Mike.” 6 Elizabeth Taylor and her groom, Conrad “Nickie” Hilton, Jr. in the limousine that will take them to their wedding reception at the Bel-Air Country Club.

Victoria Beckham said childhood bullies taunted her for her disability By McKenzie Beard Published Oct. 25, 2025, 1:21 p.m. ET Not even Posh Spice could escape childhood bullying. Victoria Beckham opened up this week about being taunted and teased at school, revealing she struggled “enormously” with her academics. “I’m a self-diagnosed dyslexic. I suffer from dyscalculia,” the fashion designer said during an Oct. 22 appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. “All those things that weren’t recognized when I was a kid. They just called me ‘thick.’” 3 Victoria Beckham’s struggles in the classroom were compounded by schoolyard bullies. Call Her Daddy/Youtube Beckham, 51, described herself “quite an awkward child” who was more focused on dance and drama lessons than fitting in with classmates, who she said threw cans at her on the playground. “My entire school life was miserable,” the former Spice Girl said. Here’s everything you need to know about dyscalculia, the little-known learning disorder that made her classroom years a constant struggle.

It’s a learning disorder that makes it difficult to understand and work with numbers and math, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Scientists aren’t exactly sure what causes it, but research shows that people with dyscalculia often have differences in brain areas like the parietal and frontal lobes, which handle number processing. 3 The first signs of dyscalculia usually appear in childhood, especially when a child begins learning numbers and basic math. Tatiana Cheremukhina – stock.adobe.com Studies also show it can run in families, hinting at a possible genetic link. Some people develop acquired dyscalculia later in life. This isn’t considered a learning disorder, instead, it usually occurs after brain damage that affects math skills. See Also Nearly 1 in 10 US kids diagnosed with developmental disability: CDC How common is dyscalculia? While less well-known than dyslexia, dyscalculia is more common than you might think. Up to 7% of elementary school children have it, meaning a typical classroom may have one or two students struggling with numbers, according to the Learning Disabilities Association of America. Research shows a significant overlap with dyslexia, with up to 40% of kids with reading struggles also having trouble with math. What are the signs of dyscalculia? Dyscalculia usually shows up in childhood, but many adults have the learning disorder and don’t realize it, according to the Child Mind Institute. 3 Beckham said her childhood struggles helped prepare her for the harsh realities of fame. X/victoriabeckham In the classroom, signs may include: Trouble recognizing numbers Counting slowly or relying on fingers, even for small numbers Difficulty linking numerals to words (5 vs. “five”) Struggling with patterns and sequencing Trouble learning math functions, multiplication tables and fractions Difficulty solving multi-step word problems See Also education How innovative new programs help the neurodiverse live more inclusive lives In daily life, people with dyscalculia may experience: Trouble measuring or following recipes Struggles with money, tips or estimating costs Forgetting numbers like phone numbers or zip codes Difficulty judging distances or travel time Trouble remembering directions or telling left from right Problems reading clocks and telling time In addition, people with dyscalculia often experience anxiety, depression or other stress when confronted with numbers. Can it be treated? There’s no cure, but children can improve with early intervention. Treatment usually involves one-on-one programs with a specialized teacher who can help the students learn how to approach math in a more effective way. For adults, dyscalculia isn’t considered treatable unless it’s acquired later in life. That’s because their brains are fully developed. For older patients, treatment typically centers around learning coping strategies, including how to use technology and other practical workarounds to compensate for the disability. Acquired dyscalculia in adults may be treatable, but it depends on the underlying cause.

Lithuania closed its two largest airports and their border with Belarus after at least one helium weather balloon smuggling cigarettes violated controlled airspace. Vilnius and Kaunas airports were shut down until 2 a.m. Saturday morning after the balloons carrying the smokes were spotted by Lithuanian authorities late Friday night. 3 An officer inspects a balloon used to smuggle cigarettes into Lithuania. Belarusian smugglers often use them to ferry the contraband into the European Union. AP Lithuania’s National Crisis Management Center said it detected “tens of balloons” on its radar Friday, Reuters reported. The nation’s border with Belarus will remain closed until Sunday with leadership placing blame on Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko who has not stopped the practice of smuggling goods with balloons. “The National Security Commission will meet next week to assess … what can be done short-term that would be painful to the smugglers and to Lukashenko’s regime, which allows them to thrive,” Lithuania’s Prime Minister Igna Ruginiene said in a statement.

An English teacher’s assistant was fired for hanging over 150 British flags around his hometown — and blackballed from other jobs after twisted former colleagues labeled him a bigot for his love of king and country and speaking out against migrant grooming gangs. Single dad-of-one Shaun Remmer, of Thirsk, was reported to the officials of Wellburn Hall School in September for “racism” for hanging the Union Jack as well as the flags of Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Ulster, he told Yorkshire Live. 3 British dad Shaun Remmer hung more than 150 flags around his hometown but got fired from his job for the patriotic postings and for “racist” posts to social media.

The post was all about children — as that is who I am trying to protect,” he said. 3 One such flag was the iconic St. George Cross.

Local leaders are waking up to the glaring problem with same-day registration voting, which is when a non-registered voter shows up on election day with a valid ID and casts a ballot.

Drivers are asked for proof of citizenship when applying for a license, said state officials, who insisted non-citizens would not be registered to vote if they failed to provide proper documentation. “Their explanation is that if someone shows up and doesn’t have a US birth certificate, then they’re not going to be opted into the registration for voters,” Robbins said. “But there’s just no way to know.” Minnesota is being sued by the Trump administration alongside six other states — including New York and California — for failing to turn over their voter rolls. “If our voter rolls are so clean why is he hesitating to produce it?” Robbins asked. “It begs the question, ‘Is it because they’re afraid there are not citizens?\u0027” Filed under minnesota tim walz voter fraud 10/25/25 Read Next Miami Heat guard hires lawyer for NBA gambling scandal who...

They hope this one results in a win. Justin Fields is going to start at quarterback against the Bengals after the team ruled out backup Tyrod Taylor on Saturday with a knee injury. Taylor did not make the trip to Ohio with the team. The quarterback decision has been a mystery all week as coach Aaron Glenn declined to offer clarity on who would start. Now, it is clear that Taylor’s injury played a role in that subterfuge. It is unclear if Taylor would have started had he been healthy.

Fields was benched at halftime of last week’s 13-6 loss to the Panthers in favor of Taylor. Then, owner Woody Johnson criticized Fields on Tuesday at the league meetings. 3 Justin Fields looks to pass as he is pressured by Dante Fowler Jr. during the Jets’ Week 5 home loss to the Cowboys. Bill Kostroun/New York Post CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND JETS STATS “If we could just complete a pass, it would look good,” Johnson said. “The offense is just not clicking. And you can’t run the ball if you can’t pass the ball. It’s Football 101.” Fields said he was unaware of the comments on Wednesday when he spoke to reporters but he said Johsnon is entitled to his opinion. “Everybody knows I need to play better, we need to play better as a team, and of course no matter how the offense does as a unit, I’m going to get the blame and I understand that,” Fields said. “That’s just what comes with the job. Honestly, it’s what comes with it, so you can’t let anything affect your mind, my mind, and that is what is. No matter if it’s him, no matter if it’s family members, or even teammates sometimes. There’s going to be times where you have to be the only one who believes in yourself. Like I said, that’s his opinion, and like I told you guys after the game on Sunday, I’m at peace and all my focus is right now is working each and every day and getting better.” 3 Tyrod Taylor throws a pass during the Jets’ Week 7 home loss to the Panthers on Oct. 19, 2025. for the NY POST The Jets have been brutal on offense this season and at 0-7 head to Ohio in search of their first win against a Bengals (3-4) team that played well in a win over the Steelers last week.

Rozier’s lawyer Jim Trusty represented the president after the 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid in the Trump classified documents case and the January 6 cases that both imploded, as well as Trump’s defamation suit against CNN (a Florida judge tossed the suit against the network in 2023). Trusty dropped off the cases in June 2023, citing “irreconcilable differences,” although Trump thanked him at the time and said he had been up against a “sick\u0027” group of people. When he stepped down from the classified documents case, he was replaced by Todd Blanche, who is now the No. 2 at DOJ. Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier has hired former Donald Trump lawyer Jim Trusty while facing federal conspiracy charges IMAGN IMAGES via Reuters Connect Trusty has experience in complex white-collar defense matters, but it is likely that his expertise with RICO cases and the mob that influenced the embattled player’s selection of him. Trusty ran DOJ’s Organized Crime section for six years during the Obama administration. Just as he did while advocating for Trump, Trusty came out swinging against federal prosecutors – in a case where Rozier is accused of conspiracy to commit fraud in an alleged sports betting scheme where prosecutors say associates wagered more than $200,000 that he would underperform in a 2023 game.

That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case,” he sneered in a Thursday statement. “Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case,” he said of the now infamous game between the Charlotte Hornets and the New Orleans Pelicans, where Rozier left after playing just 10 minutes in a game that flagged “unusual betting activity,” according to a January NBA statement. Lawyer Jim Trusty represented Trump in the classified documents case before his sudden withdrawal in 2023 NexusOne Consulting Prosecutors allege he told a friend he was going to “prematurely remove himself in the first quarter” for the purposes of “enabling” the friend to wager on his performance. “Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight,” Trusty added.

AP The Justice Department charged 31 defendants — including Portland Trail Blazers Coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat point guard Terry Rozier and ex-Cleveland Cavaliers player Damon Jones — in a major gambling bust Thursday that involved several major organized crime families. “I can guarantee you that there’ll be some resulting class actions coming out of all this,” gaming attorney Ernest Matthews said.

AP Court documents also allege that Billups, 49, tipped off gamblers that the Trail Blazers were planning to tank a game — though he has yet to be charged for that scheme. “Everybody in the industry is concerned what this means, everybody. And it goes to … the Players Association and everybody on the business to business side involved in the handling of wagering transactions,” said Dunbar, whose firm’s clients include several major sports betting sites. The perception that the NBA is “getting in bed” with gaming companies could open the league up to hefty litigation from aggrieved gamblers, Matthews claimed. 4 Legal experts including Marc Dunbar, predicted legal action from gamblers because of the scandal. Courtesy of Marc Dunbar 4 Gaming attorney Ernest Matthew believes class action lawsuits could be filed because of the accusations. Courtesy of Ernest Matthews On the other hand, bettors would have a tough time going after gaming sites due to their onerous terms and conditions, said Dunbar, whose firm also represents the New Orleans Pelicans. When signing onto a betting website or app, many gamblers agree to settle any potential claim in arbitration — a process that may not even be conducted in the US. “In some cases, the arbitration could be where [the betting websites’] risk management is ultimately handled, which could be in the country of Malta,” Dunbar said. Dunbar said that the players — and Billups — might be the most vulnerable to lawsuits due to federal anti-match fixing statutes that make it a crime to deliberately throw a professional sporting event. “You can use those as a basis for civil racketeering claims … you definitely have enough actors and enough money involved to probably meet racketeering thresholds,” he said.

About 86.19 million Americans belonged to the picket-fence crowd as of April 1, down 0.1% from the 86.28 million who owned homes at the same point in 2024. The United States last saw a drop in home ownership in the second quarter of 2016, when there were 74.36 million deed holders — down 0.1% from the 74.4 million at the same point in 2015. 3 As of April 1, 86.19 million Americans belonged to the picket-fence crowd, down 0.1% from the 86.28 million who owned homes at the same point in 2024. Tierney – stock.adobe.com 3 Inflation, high interest and mortgage rates and skyrocketing real estate prices have priced a lot of people out of the housing market, Redfin’s head of economics research Chen Zhao told The Post.

Over a decade of low mortgage rates since the 2008 financial crisis had helped people buy homes until recently, explained Chen Zhao, Redfin’s head of economics research. “That all of a sudden changed in 2022, when we had high inflation and interest rates started hiking up” — sparking a “huge increase in mortgage rates,” Zhao said. “And now that we’ve been at this much higher level of mortgage rates for three years, that’s what’s weighing on the homeownership rate, and that’s why we’re seeing the rate falling now,” Zhao told The Post. And with sky-high real estate prices, “a lot of people are priced out of the housing market,” she said. Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans who rent their homes increased from 34.9% as of Jan. 1 to 35% in the second quarter of 2025 — a shift Zhao attributed to “relative affordability.” “Rentals have gotten pretty cheap relative to the housing market. So rents are certainly high and a lot of families are rent-burdened, but relative to buying a home, in most parts of the country, renting actually seems like a relative bargain,” she said. Young Americans pushing off getting married and starting families, thus buying homes later in life, may also be a contributing factor to decreased homeownership and more renter households, Zhao noted. 3 Young Americans pushing off getting married and starting families, thus buying homes later in life, may also be a contributing factor to decreased homeownership, Zhao said. gstockstudio – stock.adobe.com New York City had the second-lowest homeownership rate in the second quarter of 2025, at 49.4%, out of the country’s 75 biggest metro areas, following Los Angeles, which had 46.4%. Over half of Big Apple residents, or 51.3%, were homeowners in the same period in 2023, and 50.6% were titleholders at that point in 2022. But the city’s homeownership rate is back on the rise after dipping to 47% as of Jan. 1 — the lowest it’s been in at least six years.

DeMille signed an $11.5 million, three book deal with Simon \u0026 Schuster in December 2014, and delivered the first two before his death in September 2024 at age 81, according to court papers. Simon \u0026 Schuster paid a $640,000 advance for the third book as well as $635,000 for an outline of the project, for a total of $1.275 million, it claimed in legal filings. 3 Nelson Demillle died in September 2024 at age 81.

The payments in question “were never made to DeMille and remained unearned as of his passing,” they wrote in an Oct. 6 Nassau Surrogate Court filing. “Put another way, there is nothing to ‘claw-back.\u0027” But on Oct. 7, Simon \u0026 Schuster filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court against Alex DeMille and his sister, Lauren DeMille, who are co-executors of their father’s estate seeking repayment. The New York Times bestselling author and father of three from Long Island, who also has a younger son, James, began his literary career in the 1970s, with the 1978 novel “By the Rivers of Babylon.” He went on to write or co-write nearly 30 books including 1997’s “Plum Island” which introduced the character of John Corey, a retired NYPD detective.

Aleksandra Putnam worked as a payroll processor and operations manager, between 2016 and 2023, for Elizabeth Slavutsky and Armando Soto — a married couple who own and operate Blue Dog Cookhouse and Bar at Two Worldwide Plaza in Hell’s Kitchen. 5 Aleksandra Putnam is relying on loans from friends to cover her bills.

But this summer, Putnam began receiving notices, claiming she owed taxes on Blue Dog’s behalf. When she reached out to Slavutsky, the restaurateur claimed it was a mistake, according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Yet Putnam’s bank accounts were frozen soon after and tax records reported her owing $2.5 million in arrears.

The suit alleges the couple knew what they were doing, and have done nothing to remedy the situation. 5 Putnam (pictured with attorney James DeCristofaro) has developed health issues because of the situation. Leonardo Munoz “Aleksandra needs her life back,” said her attorney, James DeCristofaro. Putnam is urging the courts to unblock her accounts, order the New York tax department to return the money they took, and produce a formal declaration that it’s her ex-employers who owe the $2.5 million in back taxes. 5 Putnam’s bank balance is in the red — by more than a million, according to court records.

The Merchant’s House Museum is so haunted that its staff actually hired its own ghost hunter — who spilled its bone-chilling secrets to The Post ahead of Halloween. “Manhattan’s Most Haunted House,” at 29 East Fourth St. between Bowery and Lafayette, belonged over a century ago to Seabury Tredwell, a wealthy merchant who lived there with his wife and eight children — and paranormal investigator Dan Sturges says the family never left. 5 The Merchant’s House Museum is considered “Manhattan’s Most Haunted House.” Helayne Seidman Sturges, who has conducted over 100 investigations at the house, which was built in 1832 and purchased by Tredwell in 1895, says he recorded sounds of footsteps, piano playing and even deceased residents speaking. “We’re catching these strange, anomalous voices that aren’t heard at the time of the recording,” he told The Post. Explore More 1 dead, 6 injured in mass shooting at university homecoming event Third Disney World death in 10 days casts pall over Florida\u0027s Magic Kingdom Bozo clad in full Nazi uniform breaks woman\u0027s nose outside Georgia college bar “I got direct answers to questions saying, ‘Mr. Tredwell, did you know how to play the piano?’ And we recorded, ‘Yes. I strike the keys in succession.’ “And a girl in Mrs. Tredwell’s room asked permission to use a mirror and she asked, ‘Mrs. Tredwell, do you think I look pretty?’ And we recorded a female voice saying, ‘Pleasant enough.\u0027” Museum employees there after hours have also reported inexplicable activity. 5 Dan Sturges has conducted more than 100 paranormal investigations at the residence, which was inhabited by the Tredwell family from 1835 to 1933. Helayne Seidman “A staff member was working late in the offices on the third floor. Around 10 p.m. she distinctly heard footsteps of several children running about on the floor above and jumping onto the descending staircase. She heard no voices, just the patter of children’s footfalls, at which she decided to call it night,” said the museum’s director of operations, Emily Hill-Wright. The Tredwells’ eighth child, Gertrude — the last remaining family member who lived alone in the NoHo abode for 24 years — kept the house in its original condition, “as Papa would have wanted.” Start your day with all you need to know Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

After she passed, her cousin purchased the residence, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1936 turned it into a museum. During its renovation, workers reported seeing a ghost, and in 2002, she was seen there again. 5 A visitor to the Merchant’s House Museum took this photo of a mirror there, with what appears to be a male figure in its reflection. Courtesy of Dan Sturges “The same woman in the same brown dress, drinking a cup of tea and staring out the kitchen window, was reported by different people decades apart,” Sturges said. The nearly 10,000-square-foot 19th-century brick and marble row house, one of the last examples of late-Federal and Greek Revival architecture, has five floors guests can visit, plus an attic and a cellar that are off limits. There are seven bedrooms, but only two, plus the servants’ quarters, are open to guests. 5 A museum curator once arranged the Tredwell’s teacups, saucers and a teapot for an exhibition, and when he returned, they were rearranged. AP It is the only home in the city that is preserved both inside and out, with the furniture, dishes and clothes there all the same ones that the Tredwells used. Hill-Wright recalled an instance where a curator found some of the family’s belongings — 3,000 of which are on display — mysteriously moved. “He set up a display of Tredwell family teacups, saucers, and a teapot … Just as he completed his task, he was called to the telephone in the gift shop, down the hall … Upon his return, a minute or two later, he found all of the china completely rearranged. Yet he had heard nothing, and knew no one else had been in the room during his absence,” said Hill-Wright. For his investigations, Sturges uses multiple recorders, electromagnetic field detectors and directional microphones specific to the rooms there — and all of his findings are sent to digital forensic examiners, photography experts and audio analysts for confirmation. 5 Sturges poses with the fake corpse of Seabury Tredwell, who lived at the East Fourth Street home with his wife and eight children. Helayne Seidman He even arranged a séance at the Merchant’s House in 2007 and hired psychic medium Richard Schoeller, who was picked up at Penn Station and not told what address he was going to. Schoeller, “blew everybody’s minds,” when he provided information on the Irish servants who lived there, which were later verified with census records at the New York Historical Society. “He was coming up with first names, last names of the servants, dates that they worked there. And the correct towns where these girls came from,” Sturges marveled. Schoeller also mentioned an S-shaped, red settee, a piece of furniture that went missing from the house. “When he brought that up, the museum director said, ‘There’s nobody in the world that knows that information except for me and the person I was speaking to in my office.\u0027” Filed under exclusive ghosts halloween haunted houses history houses manhattan museums noho paranormal activity 10/25/25 Read Next World\u0027s longest 3,100-mile marathon is a hellish 50-day lo...

Federal Election Commission filings show the five-term senator’s receipts slowed to a relative trickle for the last three months — raising questions about the 74-year-old’s future in a party in the throes of a far left youth movement. The Brooklyn Democrat brought in just $133,000 during the three months ending Sept. 30 – while facing a potential primary challenge from “Squad” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx and Queens), 36, who raised $4.5 million during the last quarter for her House reelection campaign. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) brought in just $133,000 during the three months ending Sept. 30, according to his latest campaign filings AP She has refused to rule out a challenge to Schumer — and even the the White House could be in her sights. Schumer’s haul was less than half of the $337,000 he brought in during the equivalent period of his 2022 election — his October 2019 report. Senators serve six-year terms and typically ramp up fundraising as their race nears. He actually spent more on his political operation than he raised from July through September, shelling out $322,000, his latest campaign filing reveals.

Those three industries are his top backers of his leadership PAC, according to Open Secrets. During the final October quarter before his election in 2022, Schumer brought in a staggering $5.9 million for his own campaign. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has refused to rule out a potential primary challenge against Schumer The Washington Post via Getty Images The Schumer-linked Senate Majority PAC hauled in a record $119 million in the period ending in October last year. He’s got $8.6 million in the bank — which trails AOC’s $11.8 million political war chest for her 2026 reelection race. “There’s a big political and financial upside to being bold and capturing energy, and in this moment that accrues to AOC, not Chuck Schumer,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “He cannot avoid noticing that AOC is the kind of person inspiring people and therefore getting fundraising benefit.” Schumer, who will turn 78 in January of 2029, is already taking heat from his left-wing comrades for backing fellow septuagenarian candidates, such as Maine Gov. Janet Mills, 77. “Chuck is focused on raising money for Senate 2026 candidates,” said Schumer spokesman Angelo Roefaro. There’s little doubt Schumer, who has been rallying Democrats to demand funding for Obamacare subsidies during the government shutdown, can pick up the pace if he wants to. “When he needs it, he’ll have it,” said longtime political consultant Hank Scheinkopf.

Penix sustained the injury to his left knee during a game last weekend against the 49ers, and while he told reporters Wednesday that he planned to play, he was limited in practice all week and officially listed as questionable heading into Sunday. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris told reporters Friday that Cousins had taken a “significant” amount of reps during the week at practice. 3 Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins (18) looks to pass in the fourth quarter at Bank of America Stadium.

IMAGN IMAGES via Reuters Connect But one month later, the Falcons selected Penix at No. 8 overall in the NFL draft, and when Cousins’ 6-3 start fizzled later in the year and Atlanta lost four of five games, Morris turned to Penix for their final three games. That carried over into 2025, and even when Penix was benched during an ugly 30-0 loss to the Panthers, Morris reiterated his support for Penix as his starter — saying that “Kirk lost his job last year.” “We’re not even close to that with Mike,” Morris told reporters in September. “He had a bad game.” make every NFL game pay off Underdog Fantasy Underdog is where football fans become winners.

Franklin Township Police Sgt.

School – Hunterdon / Facebook Bollaro had been dispatched to investigate three 911 calls from Semanchik’s concerned neighbors, but never actually went to the home, Hunterdon County Prosecutor Renée M. Robeson said. Instead, Bollaro “falsely stated in his report that he ‘checked the area along Upper Kingtown Road again and was unable to locate the source of the shots,’ and that he ‘cleared the scene after approximately 20 minutes,\u0027” Robeson’s office alleged of the Aug. 1 incident. Bollaro was outed by GPS data and surveillance footage that contradicted his account — and instead revealed his drive 1.5 miles in the opposite direction, to a TD Bank on Route 31 in Clinton Township, prosecutors said.

Epstein shelled out a string of campaign contributions to prominent candidates when he was traveling in powerful social circles that included financial and political elites. Most were Democrats, and many recipients returned the cash or made equivalent donations to charity after his shocking arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019. Senate Democrats are still clinging to tainted Jeffrey Epstein cash even while hectoring the Trump administration over releasing files about the notorious pedophile financier. Gregory P. Mango The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, now headed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), took a different tack – keeping the $59,000 in Epstein contributions it accumulated through a series of donations between 1994 and 2000.

At the time, the group was run by New Jersey Sen. Robert Toricelli (D-N.J.), who would later quit the Senate in 2002 amid corruption allegations. The Democratic National Committee similarly kept $32,000 in Epstein contributions. Don Fowler, a former DNC chair, ridiculed the idea of returning money back in 2019, telling CNBC: “Go back and give money that he gave 20 years ago? Are you nuts? That’s my answer to that.” The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, now headed by NY Dem Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, is keeping the $59,000 in Epstein contributions it accumulated through a series of donations between 1994 and 2000. LP Media Six years later, the Epstein saga is still a massive news story – and Democrats are browbeating the Justice Department to release Epstein files. In September, with President Trump taking heat over the Epstein saga amid internal turmoil, the Senate voted to kill a procedural move by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to release the files.

The DSCC piled on in September, accusing Republican senators who voted to kill the effort of “siding with the rich and powerful.” House Democrats are also turning up the pressure – as House Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to swear-in newly elected Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) during the government shutdown. The incoming lawmaker says she will sign a petition to force a vote on the Epstein files, giving the effort the needed 218 votes.

It viciously mauled a sweet elderly New Jersey couple that had been generously feeding the stray for years. The orange feline had become rabid, authorities confirmed. 3 The rabid orange cat who mauled the elderly couple had severe injuries indicating it got into a scrape with a raccoon. Blairstown Police Department The unidentified pair were left bloodied by the feral feline outside their home in Warren County Tuesday, the Blairstown Township Police Department announced in a Facebook post. Police were able to capture the kitty at the scene — and were shocked by the absolute carnage it had wrought. “The amount of blood on their driveway was absolutely shocking knowing that it all came from a cat attack,” Animal Control Officer Robert Lagonera wrote in a Facebook post.

Lagonera said, “The nasal cavity was literally exposed.” The injuries were indicative of a run-in with a raccoon, which can often be rabid. The sick cat later tested positive for rabies, according to Lagonera. 3 Officials said the amount of blood in the driveway was “absolutely shocking.” Natalia – stock.adobe.com The cat, which was euthanized, had been “still lunging at people with a broken leg,” the chief said. The couple drove themselves to an area hospital where they were treated for their wounds and received rabies shots, according to Johnsen. The brutal attack left the couple with injuries all over — and possibly even more scarred by the betrayal, the chief said. “They’re quite upset about it,” he added. 3 The couple was forced to receive rabies shots at an area hospital. jarun011 – stock.adobe.com Lagonera said there’s no current outbreak and no cause for concern to the general public. “Don’t panic. Every cat is not rabid right now,” he said, adding, “This is quite rare.” Warren County, in rural northern New Jersey, has a large wild cat population including many barn cats who are more prone to encounters with wild animals that can result in rabies infections. “Cats is such a tough topic in this world because there’s so many ferals and there’s no place to put them all,” Lagonera said, while warning against ‘open feeding.” Filed under animal attacks cats new jersey rabies 10/25/25 Read Next Mamdani tears up recalling his Muslim aunt’s fears after...

The reclusive Mellon was identified as the source of the funds in a Saturday report by The New York Times. President Trump announced this week that “a friend” who “loves the military and loves the country” – but who didn’t want to be identified – had given the funds. The wealthy donor who donated $130 million to try to pay US troops during the government shutdown has been revealed to be billionaire heir and businessman Timothy Mellon. Alamy Stock Photo Trump referenced the contribution en route to Asia Friday night, calling the request for anonymity “pretty unusual in the world I come from,” calling the donor a “great gentleman” and a “great patriot.” The White House declined to comment and referred questions to the Department of War and the Treasury Department, which did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

The family is believed to be worth $14 billion, according to Forbes. A day after Trump’s 2024 conviction for fraud in New York, Mellon donated a stunning $50 million to the pro-Trump super PAC Make America Great Again. He lives in Wyoming, where he has kept a low profile. Andrew Mellon, who served as the nation’s Treasury Secretary from 1921 to 1932, amassed a fortune in the years leading up to the Great Depression, and ultimately made significant philanthropic contributions to the National Gallery of Art and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The Pentagon said that it would accept the donation, and President Trump stated a day earlier that the donation was coming from “a friend.” Aaron Schwartz – Pool via CNP/Shutterstock The Pentagon accepted his grandson’s donation, but might not be able to use the funds: the Antideficiency Act bars agencies from spending money that has not been appropriated by Congress during a shutdown. “The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’ salaries and benefits,” said Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. The Senate on Thursday voted down an effort to pay active duty members of the military, 54-45. Trump tried earlier this month to make sure troops were paid during the weeks-long federal shutdown. “I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site. The Pentagon identified the source as leftover research and development funds. But questions have been raised as to whether that move overrode Congress’ authority under the Constitution to direct spending for explicit purposes.

Trump told reporters as he left Washington he was “open” to meeting Kim for the fourth time – days after North Korea fired off ballistic missiles in the region. 3 President Trump was direct about his intentions for the upcoming meeting with China’s president, Xi Jinping. REUTERS “I would. If you want to put out the word, I’m open to it,” Trump said late Friday en route to Malaysia. “He knows I’m coming. I’d be open to it 100 percent.” Trump is set to attend two broader summits, one in Kuala Lumpur and another in Gyeongju, South Korea, but it is his bilateral talk with Xi that has the potential to either soothe or settle a trade war and impact global hot spots.

Here he is laying out his highest concern is fentanyl,” said China expert Michael Pillsbury. The president got a jump start on his week of diplomacy by hosting the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, on Air Force One during a refueling stop. Trump thanked him for his role pushing for the Israel-Hamas peace deal. Trump heads to Tokyo Monday morning local time for his first meeting with Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Takaichi – a drummer in her past life – is preparing to announce the Japanese government will purchase a fleet of U.S.-made Ford pickup trucks, a source familiar with the plans told the Post.

The bombastic former World Chess Champion posted a bizarre official statement on social media on Saturday after the chess community and even Naroditsky’s mother pointed the finger at Kramnik for nearly two years of unfounded cheating allegations that many claim deeply affected the beloved US grandmaster’s state of mind prior to his death Wednesday. “I have never made any personal attack or insult towards Daniel Naroditsky,” wrote Kramnik, who repeatedly impugned the upright and ethical chess master. 3 Vladimir Kramnik, a former World chess champion, has a history of baseless cheating allegations and is being criticized for his repeated attacks against Daniel Naroditsky, who died tragically on Oct. 19. AP Kramnik, 50, then seemingly contradicted that claim and wrote he has “a significant amount of evidence” which supported his allegations that Naroditsky, 29, violated fair play rules — and was “ready to provide these materials to any relevant authority.” Later in the tone-deaf note, Kramnik claimed he’d been the subject of a harassment campaign ever since Naroditsky’s demise — and in poor taste announced to the world that he was not suicidal.

Naroditsky was found unresponsive in his North Carolina home, on Oct. 19, in a death that is being investigated as a possible suicide or drug overdose, according to authorities. His grieving mother, Elena, stated the mental anguish resulting from the cheating allegations by Kramnik, who was once one of her son’s idols, was simply too much to bear. 3 Naroditsky became a chess grandmaster at age 18 and was a beloved member of the chess community in the US and on the internet. Charlotte Chess Center “There was nothing more important to Daniel than his dignity as a chess player. And the ex-world champion was trying to say he was a cheater,” she told the DailyMail. “Daniel tried to defend himself so much. “He played more and did more and more because he was trying to prove that he’s not what he was accused of.” Kramnik has a history of making baseless claims against younger, rising chess stars. 3 The statement was posted to social media on Saturday. Vladimir Kramnik / X Even Hikaru Nakamura – currently the best US chess player, most popular chess streamer and second-highest ranked player in the world — was accused of cheating in online chess by the conspiratorial Kramnik. The ex-world champ also attacked a lower-rated Peruvian grandmaster, Jose Martinez, who called out the baseless attack in August 2024 and defended his honor in a chess match against Kramnik. Martinez acquitted himself well in the 36-game match though Kramnik eked out a victory.

But responsible policymaking also weighs the impact on kids later. Do child protection investigations have enduring effects? Do they make kids healthier in the long run? The cited study does not answer these questions. Research also shows that the child welfare system is traumatizing and causes many negative effects that ripple for years after an investigation. The authors omit that the study itself says “a large body of evidence shows that both cash and in-kind transfers may have long-term benefits to children.” Strategies like financial support are an important part of child welfare policy solutions in a system that, regrettably, cannot be solved with one data point.

The case for Cody Bellinger He had a 2025 on par with Kyle Tucker, who is viewed as the top free agent available, and one who should top $300 million and possibly reach $400 million. The lefty-swinging Bellinger had 5.0 WAR (Baseball Reference), 29 homers and a 125 OPS-plus compared to the lefty-swinging Tucker’s 4.5/22/143. Bellinger helped the 2025 Yankees with not just all five tools, but by seamlessly — and willingly — moving among the three outfield positions and first base. He limits strikeouts (career-low 13.7 percent), his 1.016 OPS was the best lefty hitter vs. lefty pitcher this year, and he had a .977 OPS with runners in scoring position. He has played in the three largest markets — Los Angeles, Chicago and New York— and clearly is not cowed by any stage.

The Democratic socialist, who has in the past refused to condemn the antisemitic phrase “globalize the intifada” which is seen as a call for violence against Jews, accused ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his other opponents Friday of stoking Islamophobia in a bid to bring down his campaign. “I want to speak to the memory of my aunt,” Mamdani told the crowd in front of the Islamic Cultural Center of The Bronx, pausing to choke back tears, “who stopped taking the subway after Sept.11th because she did not feel safe in her hijab.” Zohran Mamdani tearfully recalled his aunt’s experiences in the aftermath of 9/11 during a press conference in the Bronx Friday. Paul Martinka The progressive promised to make it his mission to stand up for NYC’s Muslim community should he be elected as mayor next month. “The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated as any other New Yorker, and yet for too long we have been told to ask for less than that and to be satisfied with whatever little we receive,” said Mamdani. “No more.” Explore More NYC voters run to the polls on first day of early voting — with impressive five time increase to last mayoral race Bill Maher sounds alarm on impending threat for Dems posed by Mamdani JD Vance slams Zohran Mamdani for making ‘his auntie’ the ‘real victim of 9/11’ “I will not change who I am, how I eat, or the faith that I’m proud to call my own,” he added. “But there is one thing that I will change. I will no longer look for myself in the shadows. I will find myself in the light.” The emotional speech came after Mamdani rattled off a series of anti-Islam sentiments made by his political opponents on the campaign trail, including a radio interview this week where Cuomo chuckled at the suggestion from conservative WABC host Sid Rosenberg that Mamdani, who is Muslim, would “be cheering” if “another 9/11” happened. He also accused GOP mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa of “slandering” him by claiming during Wednesday’s final mayoral debate that the socialist Queens assemblyman supports “global jihad.” “In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, it seems that Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement,” Mamdani said. Getty Images “In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, it seems that Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement,” Mamdani claimed. Mamdani did not address in his mosque speech his Oct. 17 visit with controversial Imam Siraj Wahhaj.

Days later he downplayed the meeting. “The same imam met with Mayor Bloomberg, met with Mayor De Blasio, campaigned alongside Eric Adams, and the only time it became an issue of national attention was when I met with him,” Mamdani said. “That’s because of the fact of my faith and because I’m on the precipice of winning this election.” If elected, Mamdani would become the first Muslim mayor of the Big Apple.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto will take the mound for the Dodgers in Game 2 of the World Series in Toronto. The Japanese hurler is coming off a complete game three-hitter against the Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, but he’s getting a much tougher task on Saturday night. The Blue Jays were one of the best-hitting teams in baseball this season, posting a .760 on-base plus slugging, which was third in the league. Specifically, Toronto was better than everyone at grinding out hits and putting the ball in play — their .265 batting average and 17.8 percent strikeout rate were both the best among all teams.

In half of their postseason games heading into Friday’s action, the Blue Jays have had double-digit hits. That stretch has come without one of their best hitters, Bo Bichette, who returned for the Fall Classic after missing a month and a half with a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto (18) looks on during batting practice ahead of the 2025 World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays in Toronto, on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. AP Their postseason success has come against some of the best pitching staffs in baseball, including starters like Max Fried, Carlos Rodon, George Kirby, Logan Gilbert, and Luis Castillo. Yamamoto comes into this game hot, but he’s largely taken advantage of average-to-below-average lineups in his big starts. During the Division Series, Yamamoto struggled against the Phillies – by far the best hitting team he’s faced during this postseason run – giving up three runs on six hits over four innings pitched.

Image source, Axel A D Brown Axel loves to do makeup looks based on creatures and monsters. “Whenever I\u0027m sketching out ideas, the first thing that comes to me is usually a colour combination that intrigues me,\" Axel says. Axel\u0027s makeup brain then moves immediately to \"what would that look like on somebody\u0027s face?\" They then start to build more depth into any character idea by creating each one “a storyline, an idea of what\u0027s happening or who these people are”. Axel says this really brings a look to life. Prosthetics for beginners Adding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor. Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy. “Latex closeLatexliquid or dipping latex is a skin-safe rubber that can be applied to create 3D prosthetic makeup and cotton wool can go a long way.” They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.” From fake blood to fashion Since appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds. Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It\u0027s very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.” Whether you\u0027re welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.

Grocers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u0027s and Morrisons signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month, along with Lidl, Aldi, Iceland, Waitrose and M\u0026S. They claimed households would \"inevitably feel the impact\" of any potential tax increases on the industry, such as higher business rates for supermarkets. The Treasury said tackling food price inflation was a \"priority\" and said it was lowering business rates for \"butchers, bakers and other shops\". In their letter to the Chancellor, supermarket bosses said if the industry was to face higher taxes, \"our ability to deliver value for our customers will become even more challenging and it will be households who inevitably feel the impact\". \"Given the costs currently falling on the industry, including from the last Budget, high food inflation is likely to persist into 2026,\" they warned. \"This is not something that we would want to see prolonged by any measure in the Budget.\" Ahead of the chancellor\u0027s Autumn Budget next month, speculation is growing over her tax and spending policies. She is widely expected to increase taxes following gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on cuts to welfare spending, which have made it more difficult for her to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules. After announcing tax rises of £40bn in her previous Budget in November, which included a hike in the amount employers are required to pay in National Insurance Contributions, Reeves said she was \"not coming back\" for more tax rises. But economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have calculated a shortfall of £22bn in the public finances and suggested Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes. The think tank cited rising borrowing costs for the government, weaker growth forecasts, and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the tight position. The £5.30 orange juice that tells the story of why supermarket prices are sky high Published 4 days ago Many industries in the run-up to the Budget often lobby their views and position to the government, but rising food prices are once again putting pressure on people\u0027s finances. The cost of many staples has spiked compared with butter prices up by 19% and milk over 12% along with chocolate and coffee rising 15%, according to the Office for National Statistics. While higher taxes and minimum wage bills have hit supermarkets, food inflation has surged in part due to poor harvests globally, with disease and droughts affecting yields. Escalating trade tensions also have an impact. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents the UK\u0027s major supermarkets, said retailers were \"doing everything possible to keep food prices affordable\". \"But it\u0027s an uphill battle,\" she claimed, \"with over £7bn in additional costs in 2025 alone,\" citing higher taxes. The boss of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has previously said that \"enough is enough\" on business taxes. The UK\u0027s largest supermarket said the higher National Insurance rate had cost it £235m this year, however, Tesco has upgraded its earnings outlook for the year, with expectations of full-year profits of between £2.9bn and £3.1bn. Lidl revealed this week that its profits had surged threefold. Sales jumped by 7.9% as pre-tax profits hit £156.8m in the year to 28 February, up from £43.6m a year earlier. The chancellor has previously said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in her budget, though on Friday she refused to rule out raising income tax, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge. Business rates Supermarket bosses highlighted that part of the government\u0027s business rates reforms posed a problem for the industry, in particular the so-called business rates surtax, which is being levied on all large commercial premises. Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices. In last year\u0027s Budget, the government announced its intention to introduce two lower figures used to calculate such rates for retail, hospitality and leisure properties with rateable values below £500,000. Meanwhile, firms with properties with rateable values at and above £500,000 will pay a higher amount, which the government says will include the majority of large distribution warehouses, such as those used by online retail giants Amazon. It is expected that the chancellor will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at next month\u0027s Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026. But the UK\u0027s supermarkets have argued large retail premises were a \"tiny proportion of all stores, yet account for a third of retail\u0027s total business rates\". They urged the chancellor to \"ensure that the proposed changes to business rates result in a significant reduction to the industry\u0027s rates burden\". \"The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail\u0027s rates burden doesn\u0027t rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,\" said Ms Dickinson. The Treasury said that business rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in the overall value of the tax base, \"so that the system continues to raise the same amount of revenue in real terms\". \"If the total value of rateable properties increases, the tax rate will generally fall,\" it added. \"This means that even if a specific property\u0027s RV goes up, its bill could still decrease if the reduction in the tax rate is large enough to offset the increase in value. \"Ultimately, what businesses pay after a revaluation depends on both the new RVs and the adjusted tax rate.\" Get in touch How would food price rises affect your budget?

There is an early flu season, health officials say, and the latest data for England showed cases and hospitalisations were increasing. NHS England said many school children will have already received the vaccine at school but there are still options for those who have not, including pop-up clinics. GP surgeries can give flu vaccines to school-aged children with certain health conditions, as well as two to three year olds, while preschoolers can also be taken to pharmacies for the vaccine. Is it a cold, flu or Covid – and how to avoid the worst Published 3 October Health checks and jabs offered at football matches Published 1 day ago Most children are offered the vaccine in a nasal spray rather than an injection. NHS England\u0027s weekly flu and Covid surveillance report said there was increased flu activity \"particularly among children\". Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said it was concerning that the flu had hit early this year and the increase among children was \"worrying\". \"Flu can spread like wildfire across schools and can make children really unwell,\" he said. \"The virus changes each year, so vaccination remains the best way to shield your child from getting seriously ill.\" He urged parents to make sure they had opted their child in for an in-school vaccine or find their nearest clinic. Pop-up clinics were being held in places like bowling alleys and fire stations, Mr Burton told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, adding that the vaccine was \"quick, easy and safe\". Dr Fari Ahmad told BBC Breakfast that while she was seeing cases, \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve quite hit the peak yet\". \"With flu, this is a war we have every year. Flu is unpredictable, it still kills people and every year we try to get enough people vaccinated so that when the big surge comes we are not decimated,\" she said. Dr Ahmad said that getting enough school-age children vaccinated meant that it made that surge better, \"because they are spreaders\". \"It will be great for the kids individually but it will also be better for all of us,\" she said. NHS England said more than 10 million vaccines have already been delivered in the latest campaign, including to almost 1.5 million school-aged children and more than 300,000 eligible two and three year olds. Free vaccines are available to those older than 65, with certain long-term health conditions, are pregnant, live in a care home, the main carer for an older or disabled person or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.

Since the beginning of President Donald Trump\u0027s second term, there have been increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement or \u0027ICE\u0027 raids all over the country. These raids are designed to crack down on people from overseas living in the US illegally, and in September ICE focused on Massachusetts, where there is a huge Brazilian population. Many Brazilian people living in the US are there perfectly legally, but many aren\u0027t and if they are arrested by ICE they face detention and ultimately deportation. Vitor Tavares of BBC Brasil has been looking into how the Brazilian communities in the US have been using messaging apps to respond to the raids in Massachusetts. In traditional silk making methods the cocoons are boiled, killing the silkworm inside.

This video can not be played Media caption, Kamala Harris says she still sees herself as having a political future and may run for the White House in 2028 ByLaura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Published 25 October 2025 Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House. In her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future. Making her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats\u0027 pick for the next election. Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right. As the Democratic party searches for answers about Republican Donald Trump\u0027s decisive victory one year ago, much of the blame has been directed at former President Joe Biden for not standing down sooner. But there have also been questions raised about whether Harris could have run a better campaign and set out a clearer message on the number one issue, the economy. In the BBC interview Harris entertained the prospect of another run at the White House, saying her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure\", see a female president. Asked if it would be her, she said, \"possibly\", confirming she is considering another run at the top job. Harris said she had not yet made a decision, but underlined that she still sees herself as having a future in politics. \"I am not done,\" the former vice-president said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it\u0027s in my bones.\" Responding to odds that place her as an outsider to win a place on the Democratic ticket - even behind Hollywood actor Dwayne the Rock Johnson - she said she never listened to polls. \"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn\u0027t be sitting here.\" Harris also said she believed predictions she made about Donald Trump behaving as a fascist and running an authoritarian government had come true. \"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that.\" She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. His removal from the airwaves, celebrated by Trump, came after the Trump-appointed regulator threatened Kimmel\u0027s broadcasters. \"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn\u0027t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.\" Harris also slammed business leaders and institutions in America who have, in her view, too easily bowed to the president\u0027s demands. \"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\" The White House was dismissive when asked for a response to Harris\u0027s comments about the president. \"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should\u0027ve taken the hint - the American people don\u0027t care about her absurd lies,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that\u0027s why she\u0027s continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\" Harris has just published her account of her rollercoaster campaign, 107 Days, the time that was left to her to run for the presidency after Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his mental acuity. In our full interview with the former vice-president, to be broadcast in the UK on Sunday at 09:00 GMT (05:00 EST), I pressed Harris several times on whether she ought to have urged Biden to make way for her sooner. How much did she really know about his health? And a question that may haunt her - whether she would be president now, not Donald Trump, if Biden had withdrawn earlier? The answer is plainly, unknowable - the great \"if\" that could have changed the fate of America. Among the Democratic soul-searching, Harris\u0027s candidacy is often disparaged, her weaknesses as a leader pinpointed as the reasons for her defeat, not just the last-minute nature of Biden\u0027s decision. When questioned about what went wrong, rather than plunge into deep analysis, her contention is because she started so late, it was almost impossible to win. Why Kamala Harris lost: A flawed candidate or doomed campaign? But having sat down with the Californian former prosecutor in the gilded surroundings of a luxury London hotel - rather than the increasingly golden surroundings of the Oval Office as Donald Trump glitzes up the decor - the possibility of power is something she is not willing to leave behind. Previous hints of her future presidential ambition seemed coy, non-committal - \"maybe, maybe not\", or \"I\u0027m not focusing on that right now\". Her candour in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment. That may be surprising given the thoroughly bruising nature of a defeat she has described as traumatising. She and her team were devastated by the defeat, which came as a surprise to them. \"My god, my god, what will happen to our country?\" Harris says she repeated when the result came through. Her attempt to explain it focuses on how narrow the gap in actual votes was between her and Trump. The popular vote was, indeed, very tight, with less than 2% in it. However, Harris was trounced by Trump in the all-important electoral college, where each state has a certain number of votes that tally up. What is the US electoral college, and how does it work? Harris was willing to drop heavy hints about her own future. But there\u0027s less willingness from her, or frankly any other senior Democrats, grappling with their party\u0027s long-term dilemmas. How does a centre-left party with mainstream leaders take on a right-wing populist leader? Is the answer to focus on Trump? Or is it to argue more forcefully for Main Street? When I challenged the former vice-president on why her campaign did not better connect with working people, she said she needed more time to do that, and pointed to a longstanding drift away from her party among that group. She regrets she didn\u0027t have long enough in 2024 to make her own pitch on bread-and-butter issues like housing, or childcare. But if she had longer next time round, it\u0027s far from guaranteed her arguments would be more compelling, or more gladly received. Kamala Harris still travels with the trappings of an entourage. Aides anxiously watch the clock as her every minute is planned with military precision. Non-stop travel, choreographed events in different capitals, a tiny number of carefully planned TV interviews. This time, Harris is on the move for a book tour, not a presidential race. But maybe, if she has her way, this is the start of another campaign after all. The full interview will be broadcast on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg at 0900 on Sunday 26 Oct 2025.

He previously worked as a digital news producer at several local news stations up and down the West Coast. Read Full Bio Faris Tanyos Updated on: October 26, 2025 / 8:20 AM EDT / CBS News President Trump announced Saturday that he is raising U.S. tariffs on Canada by an additional 10% in response to the continued airing of an anti-tariff advertisement created by the local government of the Canadian province of Ontario. In a post to Truth Social Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump described the airing of the ad during Friday night\u0027s Game 1 of the World Series as a \"hostile act.\" \"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" Mr. Trump wrote. The move comes even though Ontario\u0027s leader said the ad would be halted beginning Monday. CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on when such an increase would take effect and what imports it would apply to, and to Global Affairs Canada. Earlier this month, Ontario officials began airing an ad featuring excerpts from a 1987 radio address by the late President Ronald Reagan in which he said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\" The ad drew the ire of Mr. Trump Thursday, who reacted by terminating trade negotiations with Canada. The president also pointed to a statement from the Ronald Reagan Foundation alleging that the ad had misrepresented Reagan\u0027s original radio address. Following Mr. Trump\u0027s comments, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday \"so that trade talks can resume.\" \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,\" Ford wrote on social media Friday. \"We\u0027ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\" In his post Saturday, however, Mr. Trump claimed that Ontario officials had indicated the ad \"was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY.\" The president claimed Ontario\u0027s government allowed the ad to run on Friday during the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers \"knowing that it was a FRAUD.\" In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused the province of Ontario of spending up to $75 million on the advertisements, calling it \"propaganda coming across our border to decry the tariffs.\" \"What\u0027s the purpose of that other than to try to sway U.S. public opinion?\" Bessent said, adding that he believes it is \"interference in U.S. sovereign matters.\" Trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have been ongoing for months amid the White House\u0027s global trade war. Over the summer, Mr. Trump hiked tariffs on the country to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they\u0027re covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.

The president had a long-haul flight where he arrived in Malaysia on Sunday morning, the first stop of a three-country visit. Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters he may be discussing its purchases of Russian oil with Xi. He said China is substantially cutting back on its future purchases after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Moscow\u0027s two biggest oil companies. Chinese national oil companies will, at least in the short term, refrain from buying Russian oil, Reuters reported last week. When asked when he hopes to accomplish from the meeting with China, the president said, \"I think a complete deal.\" \"I want our farmers to be taken care of, and he wants things also. We\u0027re going to be talking about fentanyl,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday. \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.\" During a refueling stop in Qatar, Mr. Trump met with the country\u0027s emir and prime minister Saturday aboard Air Force One. The Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said that as soon as he heard the president was coming to Qatar, he wanted to have a conversation. Mr. Trump thanked the emir and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for bringing \"peace to the Middle East,\" after they served as intermediaries during the Israel-Hamas peace deal, calling them a \"great ally.\" His trip comes as the U.S. government shutdown drags on. Many federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, there are flight disruptions as already-squeezed air traffic controllers work without pay, and states are confronting the possibility that federal food aid could dry up. As Republicans reject Democratic demands to extend health care tax credits, there\u0027s no sign of a break in the impasse. But Mr.Trump himself appears to be maintaining a business-as-usual approach, including by embarking on this latest foreign trip. \"America is shut down and the President is skipping town,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said. Mr. Trump\u0027s first stop is at a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur. Trump attended the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit only once during his first term, but this year it comes as Malaysia and the U.S. have been working to address a skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia. On Sunday, he\u0027s scheduled to have a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, followed by a joint signing ceremony with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia. \"I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,\" Mr. Trump said Saturday in a Truth Social post. He also sent condolences to the people of Thailand following the death of Queen Mother Sirikit. \"I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival,\" he said. Mr. Trump threatened earlier this year to withhold trade deals with the countries if they didn\u0027t stop fighting, and his administration has since been working with Malaysia to nail down an expanded ceasefire. From there, Mr. Trump heads to Japan and South Korea, where he\u0027s expected to make progress on talks for at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories and other projects that those countries committed to in return for easing Trump\u0027s planned tariff rates down to 15% from 25%. The trip to Tokyo comes a week after Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi. Trump is set to meet with Takaichi, who is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump was close to Abe, who was assassinated after leaving office. Mr. Trump said Takaichi\u0027s relationship with Abe was \"a good sign\" and \"I look forward to meeting her.\" While there, Mr. Trump is expected to be hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and meet with U.S. troops who are stationed in Japan, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity about the planned trip. In South Korea, Mr. Trump is expected to hold a highly anticipated meeting with China\u0027s Xi on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. While the APEC summit is set to be held in Gyeongju, the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to take place in the city of Busan, according to the U.S. official. The meeting follows months of volatile moves in a trade war between China and the U.S. that have rattled the global economy. In: Trump Administration China © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Her family said in the statement, \"We will miss this truly remarkable woman, mom and grandmama.\" Born in New York on June 25, 1925, Lockhart was the daughter of Oscar-winning actor Gene Lockhart and actor Kathleen Lockhart. She made her professional debut at age 8, playing Mimsey in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. She later made her screen debut in MGM\u0027s version of \"A Christmas Carol\", playing the daughter of her real-life parents in the movie.

She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008. The actor became a household name to American audiences when she starred as Ruth Martin, the mother in \"Lassie,\" the hit TV show featuring a beloved long-haired collie that aired from 1954 to 1974. Lockhart would again capture TV audiences in her role as Maureen Robinson, the matriarch in \"Lost in Space,\" a show about a family struggling to survive in a space colony. It ran from 1965 through 1968. Lassie and actress June Lockhart attend the Early TV Memories First-Class stamp dedication ceremony. Alberto E.

A preliminary investigation by VSP found that he was \"fleeing from a pursuit initiated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when he exited his vehicle and attempted to cross the interstate.\" Officials from VSP were not involved in the pursuit but are investigating the pedestrian crash, which remains under investigation. A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said ICE stopped the vehicle in which the Honduran national was traveling as \"part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.\" \"Upon determining that the occupants were in the United States illegally, officers began detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle. However, one of the vehicle\u0027s occupants, Jose Castro-Rivera, resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway, creating a significant safety risk to himself and the general public,\" the agency said. \"Unfortunately, a passing vehicle struck Castro-Rivera.\" One of the ICE officers gave Castro-Rivera CPR before he died, the DHS spokesperson said. \"The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased,\" the DHS spokesperson said. Federal crackdowns have been occurring nationwide in recent weeks. Earlier this week, nine immigrants from Africa suspected of being in the country illegally were taken into custody by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents during what DHS called a \"targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.\" ICE deported about 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on Oct. 15.

Harris initially stayed out of the spotlight after losing the 2024 race to Donald Trump, but she has been back on the airwaves in the past month to promote her new book, \"107 Days,\" about her turbulent time as the Democratic nominee. Asked in her BBC interview whether former President Joe Biden\u0027s last-minute withdrawal from the race stymied her chance to become president, Harris said it was a question to which she will never know the answer. She said warnings she made about President Trump on the campaign trail had been proved right, calling him a \"tyrant.\" She said she believed her predictions about Mr. Trump running an authoritarian government had been realized. Harris also called out businesses and universities for, in her view, toeing the line and bowing too easily to the president\u0027s demands. The White House responded to Harris\u0027 assertions in a statement to the BBC through spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. \"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should\u0027ve taken the hint - the American people don\u0027t care about her absurd lies.\" During the interview, Harris also focused on the future and touched on the possibility of a woman being in the White House one day. Harris told the BBC her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" see a female president. She then mused on her political future, saying she still sees herself having one. \"I am not done,\" Harris said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it\u0027s in my bones.\" When asked whether she would consider another presidential run, Harris didn\u0027t commit, but didn\u0027t rule it out, saying \"possibly,\" and adding, \"I\u0027m not focusing on that right now.\" However, when CBS News polled residents in her home state of California this week on whether Harris or Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, fewer than a third of voters endorsed her having another try. Even among registered Democrats in California, which Harris won in 2024, just under half think she should run again. Most independents don\u0027t think Newsom or Harris should run, but of the two, by comparison, they are more likely to back the California governor.

The Octagon is an approximately 10,000 square foot home designed by William Thornton, who served as the first architect of the U.S. Capitol. The building sits at the corner of New York Avenue NW and 18th Street NW in Washington, D.C., and was completed in 1801. Built as a second residence for Virginia\u0027s prominent Tayloe family who were friends of George Washington, the more than 200-year old building gets its name from the shape of the main room at the main entrance. Amanda Ferrario is the manager of the house, which now doubles as a museum and event space. It\u0027s owned and maintained by the Architects Foundation, the philanthropic partner of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), which purchased the property in 1902. \"The Octagon name comes from this room that we\u0027re standing in,\" Ferrario told CBS News during a tour of the home. \"In order to build a circular room, you make the structure out of an octagonal shape and then builds it in with various building materials to give this nice smooth circle,\" she added. Ferrario says the epicenter of the house was in the basement, where several enslaved people lived and worked mostly out of sight of the wealthy occupants. \"(The basement) is the absolute epicenter of all of the activity,\" Ferrario said. \"Not only for the enslaved who would live and work here, they were sleeping here. They were working here around the clock, but also in order to operate a house of this caliber,\" she added. The Octagon also served as a home for one of America\u0027s early first families. President James Madison and his wife, Dolley Madison, temporarily relocated to the home after the British burned down the White House in 1814. Ferrario says the rent for the temporary stay was about $6,000 for their 6-month stay. She also noted the specific reason why the British did not destroy the prominent home. \"But during this time, Mr. Tayloe was quite savvy, and invited a French ambassador to stay here. He knew that if there was a French flag flying, no one\u0027s going to touch this house,\" Ferrario said. \"And it was spared, and rightfully so, because in preparation for the British coming. And Dolley Madison did send over a few of her items that meant a lot to her, so that they would be extra protected.\" President Madison used the residence to conduct official business including signing the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812. He signed the document in the home\u0027s circular office, Ferrario told CBS News. Dolley Madison brought cherished items from the White House including curtains, silverware and her pet bird. The former first lady would go on to host what became known as \"squeezes\" in the first floor sitting room. The events were gatherings of Washington\u0027s elite at the time. Over the years, The Octagon was transformed for different uses including a Catholic school for girls, a federal office building and later as tenement housing. Its storied past includes spooky and unexplained events reported by guests throughout the building\u0027s lifetime. Doors opening, lights flickering and security alarms going off without any explanation have been common occurrences in the building. \"We have an ongoing, I guess it\u0027s kind of an ongoing joke with our security monitoring company, that if the security monitors go off on the second or third floor, everything is okay. It\u0027s just our friends playing.\" Ferrario also says Jackie Kennedy Onassis — then known as Jackie Bouvier — may have had her own chilling experience in the home when she was working for a local newspaper. \"She wrote about a time when she came through to the Octagon and she was standing right where you\u0027re standing,\" Ferrario explained to CBS News. \"And she felt the overwhelming presence and a smell of lilac, which is equated to Dolley (Madison). And what she said was, it was like a former first lady looking over the shoulder of a future first lady.\" The building is currently undergoing renovations to become a prominent and cohesive part of the new headquarters for the AIA later this year. The house will also play a part in America\u0027s 250th Independence celebration after receiving a National Park Service grant for restoration efforts. Jennifer Calvert Hall serves as the Executive Director of the Architects Foundation. She hopes future visitors gain a sense of reverence for the architecture of America\u0027s early history. \"I want them to have this sense of that moment in time where our founding, sort of the people who founded the United States of America, were interested in very progressive ideas, and that those progressive ideas were reflected in its architecture. I want them to feel that,\" Calvert Hall said. In: Haunted House Halloween Washington D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Read Full Bio Sara Moniuszko, Sandra Temko Updated on: October 25, 2025 / 11:39 AM EDT / CBS News Nearly one in five urinary tract infections in a group of patients in Southern California were linked to E. coli from contaminated meat, a four-year study found. And researchers say the problem could be occurring across the United States. The researchers found 18% of the more than 2,300 urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the study — published in the mBio journal on Thursday — were linked to E. coli strains found in meat samples from grocery stores in the same area. The meats most commonly found to test positive for E. coli were turkey and chicken, followed by pork and beef, the study found. The finding reframes contaminated chicken, turkey, pork, and beef as more than food safety nuisances. UTIs are common infections that happen when bacteria enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They disproportionately affect female and elder patients, the CDC said. While most UTIs resolve with antibiotics, severe infections can reach the kidneys or bloodstream and become life-threatening. \"It\u0027s pretty frequent, one in five, and with better food safety, we could reduce it,\" Lance Price, a professor of environmental health at George Washington University and one of the study\u0027s authors, told CBS News. Tracing infection through genomic fingerprints The researchers used \"genomic attribution,\" comparing the DNA of E. coli from patients with strains found in meat to estimate how many infections come from animals. After analyzing thousands of bacterial genomes, they found that about 18% of cases carried an animal-linked genetic fingerprint, and roughly 21% in lower-income ZIP codes. Turkey was the most frequently contaminated meat, followed by chicken, pork, and beef. Price said the socioeconomic pattern echoed what he\u0027d seen in earlier fieldwork. \"In grocery stores in poorer neighborhoods, I found chicken packages pumped with saline, and that liquid can spread bacteria all over,\" Price said. \"It adds weight, but it may also be making people sick.\" The team also found higher contamination rates in large, low-cost \"value packs.\" Whether that reflects processing practices or retail handling remains unclear, but the pattern suggests consumers with fewer options may face higher exposure risks. Experts interpret the findings Tara Smith, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Kent State University who was not involved in the study, said the research was \"pretty convincing\" at showing \"that at least some of these E. coli infections are coming from animals.\" \"When you\u0027re exposed to these organisms, by handling raw meat or eating it undercooked, they can take up residence in your gut and stay there,\" she explained. \"Most UTIs come from your own gut flora. When that flora includes bacteria from animals, that\u0027s the connection.\" Meanwhile, Betsy Foxman, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Michigan, urged caution in interpreting the results. \"Sure, it\u0027s plausible,\" she said, \"but how much do we have to worry about it?\" Foxman questioned whether the 18% figure might be high, noting that UTIs vary by age, sexual activity, hormones, and other factors. \"The real evidence would be a foodborne outbreak of UTIs tied to a specific product,\" she said, though she agreed the study adds to mounting evidence that bacteria from food animals circulate more widely than most people realize. When contamination tracks with ZIP code People living in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods, according to the study. Though the reasons for the strong correlation between poverty rate and foodborne UTIs are unclear, the authors say possible factors include inadequate food safety regulations, poor retail conditions and improper food handling and hygiene practices. Foxman said that context matters. \"You have to ask whether people have access to care, whether they can store food safely, and what kind of products are reaching those markets,\" she said. \"Without that granularity, it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s really driving these differences.\" Price added these findings show why there should be more investments, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. \"We\u0027re trying to understand why this clustering happens,\" he said. \"It could be product quality, handling, or inspection, but clearly something systemic is going on.\" The animal origins of everyday infections For Price, the research underscores how human, animal, and environmental health intersect. The same E. coli lineages that infect people also afflict livestock. \"If we eliminated these bacteria in animals, by vaccine or whatever, you\u0027d probably have mutual benefit,\" he said. The study also exposes how farming and policy decisions ripple through the food chain. Although the U.S. banned antibiotics for growth promotion, farms still use them to prevent disease in crowded barns. \"Those animals can develop resistance,\" Smith said, \"and when humans are later exposed, sometimes the drugs don\u0027t work.\" Price argues that regulators should treat E. coli in meat as a serious health hazard. Stronger slaughterhouse hygiene, stricter contamination standards, and better inspection could all help. Vaccinating animals against the strains most often found in human UTIs could protect both animals and people. Food safety starts at home, but doesn\u0027t end there None of the experts advocate panic or abandoning meat altogether. As Smith noted, vegetables fertilized with manure can carry similar bacteria. The message is not abstinence but awareness: treat all raw meat as contaminated until cooked. Handwashing, sanitizing cutting boards, and avoiding splatter from packaging remain the most practical defenses. \"Don\u0027t stop eating chicken or beef,\" said Foxman. \"Just cook it well and keep your kitchen clean.\" Smith said the study underscores how food handling shapes everyday health. \"You can\u0027t always prevent UTIs once they\u0027re in your body,\" Smith said. \"But you can be vigilant about how the bacteria get there in the first place. Wash your hands. Keep your kitchen clean. Cook meat thoroughly.\" Still, Price insists that consumers shouldn\u0027t shoulder the blame alone. Regulators and industry leaders are \"not going to do anything if they don\u0027t acknowledge the risk,\" Price said. \"But if they do, they can develop systems to prevent these bacteria from getting into the food supply,\" he continued.

Official results showed strong voter support for Connolly as president, a largely ceremonial role in Ireland. She won 63% of first-preference votes once spoiled votes were excluded, compared to 29% of her rival, Heather Humphreys, of the center-right party Fine Gael. Connolly, 68, said Saturday evening at Dublin Castle that she would champion diversity and be a voice for peace and one that \"builds on our policy of neutrality.\" \"I would be an inclusive president for all of you, and I regard it as an absolute honor,\" she said. Humphreys conceded she had lost earlier Saturday, before vote counting had finished. \"Catherine will be a president for all of us and she will be my president, and I really would like to wish her all the very, very best,\" she said. Polls have suggested consistent and strong voter support for Connolly over rival Humphreys for president, a largely ceremonial role in Ireland. Connolly, a former barrister and an independent lawmaker since 2016, has been outspoken in criticizing Israel over the war in Gaza. She has garnered the backing of a range of left-leaning parties, including Féin, the Labour Party and the Social Democrats. She and Humphreys were the only contenders after Jim Gavin, the candidate for Prime Minister Micheál Fianna Fail party, quit the race three weeks before the election over a long-ago financial dispute. Independent candidate Catherine Connolly casts her vote in the election for the next Irish president at Claddagh National School in Galway city, Ireland, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. (Brian Lawless/PA via AP) Galway / AP Martin, who heads Ireland\u0027s government, had personally backed Gavin as a presidential candidate. Though Gavin had stopped campaigning, his name remained on the ballot paper because of his late withdrawal from the race. While Irish presidents represent the country on the world stage, host visiting heads of state and play an important constitutional role, they do not have the power to shape laws or policies. The leader of the Irish Labour Party said Connolly has united parties \"with an alternative vision.\" Ivana Bacik said left-wing parties could now look at how they can \"combine together\" and \"offer a real alternative\" in the next general election. Humphreys, a former cabinet minister, had stressed that she is a center-ground, pro-business, pro-EU candidate who will strive for unity. Others — including musician Bob Geldof and the former mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor — had indicated they wished to run for president but failed to receive enough backing for a nomination. Connolly will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who has been president since 2011, having served the maximum two seven-year terms. She will be Ireland\u0027s 10th president and the third woman to hold the post. Voting slips were being counted by hand. The final result will be declared later Saturday once all 43 electoral constituencies across the country have completed counting. In: Ireland © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Read Full Bio Jennifer Earl October 25, 2025 / 9:45 AM EDT / CBS News Air traffic controller Jack Criss is now clearing takeoffs and takeout orders. The single dad took on a side gig as a DoorDash delivery driver during the second-longest government shutdown in modern history in order to make some extra cash and cover his daughter\u0027s high school tuition. For the past few weeks, air traffic controllers have been receiving partial pay – but next week, they\u0027re expected to miss their first full paychecks as the funding lapse continues. \"It\u0027s been incredibly difficult. You can feel the tension, and it\u0027s heavy…and it hurts,\" Criss said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Saturday Mornings.\" As the government shutdown rolls into Day 25, Congress remains unable to strike a deal. The Senate failed to advance measuresThursday that would pay federal employees like Criss. \"It is hard enough just going to work. Now, when you add…not getting paid, that\u0027s when you just like multiply the level of pressure. And you know, air traffic is a safety sensitive position,\" Criss said. \"The margin of error is zero. So if you think about it as pressure on top of pressure, when you don\u0027t know exactly when you\u0027ll get paid based on politics.\" Criss said he has tapped into his retirement funds and taken out a high-interest, short-term loan to make sure he has the cash to weather a lengthy shutdown. While Criss has continued to clock into work, the Department of Transportation reports that it\u0027s seen an uptick in sick calls from controllers, causing staffing shortages at some airports. \"Safety is paramount for us and so if we don\u0027t have the staffing levels in a tower, TRACON or center, you will see us delay traffic; you will see us cancel flights,\" U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. Duffy has discouraged air traffic controllers from taking on side hustles to focus on their already demanding positions. \"Well, I don\u0027t want my air traffic controllers to take a second job — I want them to do one job. I don\u0027t want them delivering for DoorDash, I don\u0027t want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities, and controlling the air space,\" Duffy said Thursday at the House GOP\u0027s press conference, though he acknowledged the financial stress workers are facing to \"feed their kids and support their family members.\" But Criss says there\u0027s no way around it for struggling workers like himself. Even with the extra income from DoorDash he was \"not even close\" to covering his daughter\u0027s tuition bill. Criss shared his story with lawmakers at a televised town hall last week. After hearing his story, DoorDash reached out to offer the essential worker $10,000 to help pay for his daughter\u0027s education. If the money comes, Criss said it would be a huge help – but it still may not be enough to give up his new side job.

In the capital, Kyiv, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a ballistic missile attack in the early hours of Saturday, Kyiv\u0027s police said. A fire broke out in a non-residential building in one location, while debris from intercepted missiles fell in an open area at another site, damaging windows in nearby buildings, Ukraine\u0027s State Emergency Service wrote on the message app Telegram. \"Explosions in the capital. The city is under ballistic attack,\" Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram during the onslaught. A firefighter works to extinguish a fire at a warehouse following a Russian attack, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Julia Demaree Nikhinson / AP In the Dnipropetrovsk region, two people were killed and seven wounded, acting regional Gov. Vladyslav Haivanenko said, adding that apartment buildings and private homes were damaged in the strikes. Ukraine\u0027s air force said Russia launched nine missiles and 62 drones, of which four missiles and 50 drones were intercepted. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 121 Ukrainian drones over Russia overnight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that such attacks underline his country\u0027s need for additional U.S. Patriot defense systems. \"It is precisely because of such attacks that we pay special attention to Patriot systems — to be able to protect our cities from this horror. It is critical that partners who possess relevant capability implement what we have discussed in recent days,\" he wrote in English on X. \"America, Europe and the G7 countries can help ensure that such attacks no longer threaten lives,\" he said. Ukraine has received at least seven Patriot systems since Russia\u0027s full-scale invasion began, according to U.S. and European defense sources, and Zelenskyy is hoping to purchase 25 more from the U.S. to fortify its air defenses, particularly in cities. Smoke bellows from a warehouse that caught fire following a Russian attack, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Julia Demaree Nikhinson / AP Zelenskyy on Friday urged the United States to hit the entire Russian energy industry with sanctions and not just the two oil companies it targeted this week. He also reiterated his appeal for long-range missiles to hit back at Russia. Zelenskyy was in London for talks with two dozen European leaders who have pledged military help to shield his country from future Russian aggression if a ceasefire stops the more than three-year war. The meeting hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed to step up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding momentum to recent measures that have included a new round of new sanctions imposted by both the United States and European countries on Russia\u0027s vital oil and gas export earnings. The talks also addressed ways of helping protect Ukraine\u0027s power grid from Russia\u0027s almost daily drone and missile attacks as winter approaches, enhancing Ukrainian air defenses, and supplying Kyiv with longer-range missiles that can strike deep inside Russia. Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to send Tomahawk missiles, an idea U.S. President Donald Trump has considered but not agreed to so far. Kirill Dmitriev, Putin\u0027s envoy for investment and economic cooperation, said Friday he believes Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine were \"quite close to a diplomatic solution\" to end the three-year war. Speaking to CNN after arriving in Washington for talks with U.S. officials, Dmitriev said a planned summit in Budapest between Mr. Trump and Putin had not been canceled but would likely occur later. Mr. Trump said last week his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was put on hold because he didn\u0027t want it to be a \"waste of time.\" When asked by a reporter on Saturday what Russia has to do to reschedule his meeting with Putin, the president said, \"I\u0027m gonna have to know that we\u0027re going to make a deal. I\u0027m not going to be wasting my time.\" \"I\u0027ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing. I thought this would\u0027ve gone long before peace in the Middle East, we have Azerbaijan and Armenia. That was very tough,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Asia. \"In fact, Putin told me on the phone, he said, \u0027Boy, that was amazing, because everybody tried to get that done, and they couldn\u0027t.\u0027 I got it done.\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made clear in public comments Tuesday that Russia is opposed to an immediate ceasefire. A White House official confirmed Friday that Dmitriev, who announced his visit on X, will meet with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.

She covers current events, breaking news and issues including substance use. Read Full Bio Kerry Breen Updated on: October 25, 2025 / 8:02 AM EDT / CBS News Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham knew what was and wasn\u0027t normal for their kids. As the parents of six, they had seen a lot of illnesses and tantrums. But they were baffled by the behavior of their youngest daughter, Austyn. Austyn was \"just not happy\" and \"never content,\" Ashlee said. As an infant, she never slept and cried constantly. She was \"never smiling, never laughing,\" the toddler\u0027s mother said. She had mild developmental delays and a tremor. At 18 months old, genetic testing found she had a genetic condition called Chiari malformation. The condition occurs when the lower part of the brain does not fit inside the skull and bulges out of the opening where the skull joins the spinal cord, said Dr. David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone. It puts pressure on both the brain and spinal cord, and can cause symptoms like limb weakness, difficulty breathing, scoliosis, headaches and nerve pain, Harter said. If left untreated, it can cause lifelong pain and problems like paralysis and nerve damage. Most Chiari malformation patients are born with it. The rare condition affects 1 in every 2,000 people, he said, and has no clear cause. Ashlee had never heard of it. The Higginbotham sisters. Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham \"That moment when Austyn\u0027s MRI results came up on my screen and we read the diagnosis of Chiari malformation – that was the moment our world was flipped upside down,\" Ashlee said. \"Trying to hold it together\" More tests found that Austyn had severe compression in her spine and a spinal fluid blockage. She would need brain surgery. \"Life doesn\u0027t stop. We had five other kids, their lives were still moving, and we were trying to hold it together but we\u0027re terrified,\" Ashlee said. \"We were traveling three and a half hours away for MRIs, for bloodwork, for all these different specialists. Now we need brain surgery? Life was chaos.\" The Higginbothams traveled from West Virginia to New York City to seek care from Dr. Jeffrey Greenfield, a pediatric neurosurgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. In most cases, a surgeon would delicately decompress the brain with a combination of elevating muscle, drilling bone and expanding the dura, the sac surrounding the brain, he said. A graphic showing how Chiari malformation can appear. Conquer Chiari For very young patients, like Austyn, surgeons may only remove some of the bone. Both procedures are meant to give the brain the necessary space and to restore the flow of spinal fluid, Greenfield said. Austyn underwent surgery in March 2023. When she woke up a few hours later, she was like a different child, Ashlee said. \"She was ready to go. She was trying to get out of bed, she was trying to walk. She was smiley. It was like the pain she\u0027d always felt was gone, and the pain of surgery didn\u0027t match what she\u0027d always felt. She was just ready to run laps around the ICU,\" Ashlee recalled. \"When we did the follow-up with Dr. Greenfield, I told him, \u0027You gave me her laugh.\u0027\" The Higginbothams were relieved to find light at the end of the tunnel. But just days later, their world would be rocked again. Austyn Higginbotham after surgery. Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham \"Just as nerve-wracking as the first time\" The Higginbothams took Austyn to a local follow-up appointment five days after returning from New York. They also took Amelia, then 3, because they feared she was showing symptoms of Lyme disease after a recent tick bite. Imaging showed Amelia also had Chiari malformation, as well as a tethered spinal cord. A tethered cord is seen in about 5% of Chiari malformation patients, Greenfield said. The condition occurs when the spinal cord becomes abnormally attached to surrounding tissue, including bones, muscle or skin. Amelia would need the Chiari malformation surgery, as well as a procedure to snip the tether. The Higginbothams returned to New York and Greenfield completed both procedures in October 2023. Amelia Higginbotham with Dr. Jeffrey Greenfield. Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham Sitting in the waiting room was \"just as nerve-wracking as the first time,\" Paul said. \"It feels like days that you\u0027re just sitting there, waiting to see what the outcome is,\" he said. Like Austyn, Amelia recovered quickly, but the hits kept coming. Aubrey, then 7, was moody and had frequent urinary tract infections. One day, Ashlee realized her symptoms were familiar. \"I remember driving down the road, and it just clicked in my head. I was like \u0027Oh my gosh, I need to get an order for an MRI. She needs to be checked for a tethered cord,\u0027\" Ashlee said. \"She was our happy kid, and it was like one day she woke up and was different, like a flip of a switch, and we were losing her. I wish I would have thought of it sooner.\" Sure enough, Aubrey had both Chiari malformation and a tethered spinal cord. Less than a month after Amelia\u0027s surgery, the Higginbothams were back in Greenfield\u0027s office. Aubrey Higginbotham and Dr. Jeffrey Greenfield. Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding\" Aubrey\u0027s operation in November 2023 went well, and soon she was back to the happy child her parents recognized. But the rollercoaster wasn\u0027t over yet. Adalee, then 11, had complained of leg pain for years, but her parents had always believed it was growing pains. In sixth grade, the ache became so severe that she spent most of her free time in bed. As her symptoms escalated, the Higginbothams took her for imaging. They showed the same thing as her younger siblings: Chiari malformation and a tethered spinal cord. \"It was such a blur of \u0027You\u0027ve got to be kidding,\u0027\" Ashlee said. \"You hear of people having one or two kids, but four?\" About 10% of Chiari malformation cases have a genetic link, Greenfield said, but it\u0027s most common to see that connection between a parent and child. He felt \"a little bit of disbelief\" as the Higginbotham diagnoses kept coming. He said that the couple learning more about Chiari malformations, tethered cords and their various symptoms helped put the pieces together. Greenfield decided to operate on Adalee\u0027s cord, which was causing her pain, but not the malformation. Harter said that if a Chiari malformation is not causing symptoms, doctors will observe it and wait for it to cause issues before operating. Adalee recovered from the March 2025 operation and went on to join her school\u0027s dance team, Ashlee said. The Higginbotham sisters. Paul and Ashlee Higginbotham \"The most amazing gift\" The Higginbothams\u0027 eldest two children were screened for Chiari malformations, and do not have the condition, their parents said. Austyn underwent a successful follow-up surgery in February 2025. Higginbotham said about 20% of children who have the minimal operation need a second procedure. Now, the family is enjoying their \"new normal,\" Ashlee said. The house is full of laughter and smiles. The kids — Austyn, 4, Amelia, 6, Aubrey, 9, and Adalee, 12 — are active and happy. Some of the girls still have occasional symptoms or pain, which Greenfield said is common in older children whose Chiari malformations require surgery. It\u0027s nothing like before, the Higginbothams said. It is a relief, Ashlee said, to finally see her children healthy. \"(Dr. Greenfield) gave us our family back, and that is the most amazing gift anyone could get,\" Ashlee said. \"Some days we weren\u0027t sure how things would ever get better for our girls ... It\u0027s been a whirlwind, but we\u0027re thankful we are where we are today.\" Edited by Lucia I Suarez Sang In: Health West Virginia © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Joe previously covered breaking news for Forbes and local news in Boston. Read Full Bio Joe Walsh Updated on: October 25, 2025 / 8:29 AM EDT / CBS News President Trump late Friday pushed for several Biden-era Justice Department officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election. In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump accused four high-ranking officials — former Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, special counsel Jack Smith and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco — of signing off on an FBI probe in which investigators allegedly looked at nine Republican lawmakers\u0027 phone records. \"These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!\" the president wrote. He did not specify what crimes he believes they committed. The message marks the latest instance of Mr. Trump urging the prosecution of people he has singled out as political foes. Last month, he pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Since then, Comey and James have been criminally indicted. The GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee revealed earlier this month that the FBI obtained phone data for about eight GOP senators and one GOP representative in 2023 as part of Arctic Frost, an investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies\u0027 attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the judiciary panel, released documents that appeared to indicate Wray, Garland and Monaco approved the opening of the Arctic Frost probe in the spring of 2022. Later that year, Garland appointed Smith to independently oversee the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump. In Friday\u0027s post, Mr. Trump alleged the four former officials \"spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls\" — though the Judiciary Committee said in a statement earlier this month the records obtained by the FBI didn\u0027t include the content of calls. Instead, the data covered who the lawmakers called and when, and the length of their calls. The president also claimed — without evidence — they \"cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election.\" CBS News has reached out to representatives for Smith, Garland and Monaco for comment. Grassley excoriated the FBI over its handling of Arctic Frost earlier this month, calling the revelations about lawmakers\u0027 phone records \"disturbing and outrageous\" and part of a pattern of \"weaponization\" that was \"arguably worse than Watergate.\" Smith\u0027s attorneys called his actions \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy\" in a letter to Grassley earlier this week. The phone records that were scrutinized by the FBI covered several days both before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when Mr. Trump pressed lawmakers to vote against certifying former President Joe Biden\u0027s election win. The gambit was unsuccessful as Congress ended up voting to certify, but the process was interrupted by rioting at the Capitol. Mr. Trump was charged by Smith\u0027s team in August 2023 for conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Mr. Trump\u0027s win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution. Smith\u0027s investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking Biden\u0027s victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by him and his alleged co-conspirators to reach lawmakers by phone. It argued the president \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification.\" Last year, a final report penned by Smith also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed, one of them widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Trump has lashed out at the federal officials who investigated him in the past. His legal team has asked the Justice Department to pay him about $230 million to settle federal damage claims over two investigations into him, CBS News confirmed this week. Those claims focus on the Trump-Russia probe from his first term and the criminal case against Mr. Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents, which was pursued by Smith. And a federal watchdog office launched an investigation into Smith for alleged illegal political activity earlier this year. Smith\u0027s attorneys called the claims \"imaginary and unfounded.\" In: Christopher Wray Donald Trump Merrick Garland Jack Smith © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting.\" Such was a sentiment shared by many around the league on Friday, one day after the indictments were unsealed and nearly three dozen people — most notably, Billups and Rozier — were arrested by federal officials. Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024. Rozier\u0027s attorney, James Trusty, told CBS News in a statement Thursday that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, of investigators, but then \"at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel.\" Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting \"the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.\" Billups faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering for participating in what federal officials called Mafia-backed, rigged poker games. He also matches the credentials of someone described only as Co-Conspirator 8 in an indictment detailing how some people gave bettors inside information on player health statuses. In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday night, an attorney for Billups wrote that \"to believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game. Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.\" The arrests have overshadowed the opening week around the league. \"I apologize to our fans that we are all dealing with this situation,\" Silver said during the in-game interview. The Rozier case has gone on since March 23, 2023. He was with the Charlotte Hornets at that time, and sportsbooks — legal ones — alerted the NBA to irregular patterns involving Rozier\u0027s \"prop bets\" that day. Rozier went on to play about 9 1/2 minutes, and those who bet that he would underperform the listed stat lines won those wagers. Federal officials said more than $200,000 was bet on those lines alone. The NBA investigated and found no reason to sanction Rozier, Silver said. \"We frankly couldn\u0027t find anything,\" Silver said. \"Terry at the time cooperated. He gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. And we ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward. \"He still hasn\u0027t been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry. Obviously, it doesn\u0027t look good. But he\u0027s now been put on administrative leave. There\u0027s a balance here of protecting people\u0027s rights and investigating.\" Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue calls Billups his best friend and said the news was difficult to take. He said he spoke with Billups on Thursday night and was encouraged by what he heard. \"To go through something like this, the allegations, his family, my goddaughters, it was a tough day,\" Lue said. \"You never want to see your friends go through anything like that.\" Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers started in the NBA as a player more than 40 years ago. He\u0027s seen plenty of good and bad. He thought he had heard it all. That is, until now. \"It\u0027s really sad,\" Rivers said Friday. Along with Billups and Rozier, former NBA player Damon Jones now faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two Los Angeles Lakers players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of LeBron James and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing. \"We see now what those things can turn into and how they can spread, just how valuable this information is,\" Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \"It\u0027s a difficult situation overall but once you introduce gambling that the sports world has now, there\u0027s going to be some very dangerous situations out there for everybody — from a security standpoint, from this type of thing standpoint.\" All teams are required by the NBA to educate players, coaches and staff annually about what is allowed and not allowed when it comes to gambling. The Orlando Magic met recently about that very topic. And then after the news Thursday, they met again. \"Yesterday was another reminder of what we have to do,\" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. \"We had another conversation with the group. I think the more that is going on, the more we have to continue to talk to the group about what is happening.\" The league has at least 14 relationships with sportsbooks, including FanDuel and DraftKings. Some teams have their own deals as well. Silver has often spoken of how legal betting can be monitored and how unusual patterns can be flagged immediately, part of the reason why the league believes the integrity of games can be protected. But some coaches and players still believe more can be done. \"The league, the game and the business of the league has evolved. And so we just have to be aware of how things evolve in this business, right?\" San Antonio coach Mitch Johnson said. \"It\u0027s very important for us to continue to just be educated and mindful of everything that has to do with our business. ... I believe in Adam Silver and the league, that they will do whatever is necessary to continue to grow the game in the right way.\" Another issue for players and coaches is how social media has given bettors ways to communicate with those inside the league. Those interactions, many have said, are not always friendly. \"The outside world, in my day, couldn\u0027t get to us. They literally couldn\u0027t get to us,\" Rivers said Friday. \"And now they can, with ease.\" In: NBA Gambling Chauncey Billups Adam Silver Terry Rozier © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Wholf, Seiji Yamashita October 24, 2025 / 9:20 PM EDT / CBS News The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal Department of Interior draft documents viewed by CBS News. New leases would include waters off New England, the Carolinas and California. Offshore oil leases are common along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, as well as parts of Alaska, but there are currently no active oil leases on the Atlantic coast, and California has not had a new oil lease since 1984. This comes as the Department of Interior formally announced plans this week to reopen 1.56 million aces in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden administration decision to limit oil drilling in the Arctic. That decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who accused the administration of rewarding the fossil fuel industry for its support of the president. \"This decision is not about energy dominance—it\u0027s about donor dominance,\" Markey said in a statement. \"The Trump administration must immediately reverse its shortsighted decision. The Arctic Refuge is not for sale.\" The Department of Interior is assessing new oil leases as part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, which issues oil leases in five-year increments. The Biden administration set the previous plan and had the fewest leases on record, with only three. Offshore oil platform in California\u0027s Santa Barbara Channel. Marli Miller/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Documents reviewed by CBS News included assessments of whether state governments favored offshore drilling, and indicated that the states opposed it. The documents also included potential dates for leasing each tract of seafloor. If the plan is approved by the Interior secretary and moves forward, California could see lease sales as soon as 2027 and the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, which includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could see lease sales as early as 2026. Under the terms of the lease, a company would then have five to 10 years, depending on the water depth in the area, to explore and develop oil and gas production. The Trump administration opened a public comment period in April for a new five-year gas leasing policy. Lawmakers from both parties voiced concerns about offshore drilling, including members of Congress and state governors, and the process drew more than 34,000 comments. Governors Josh Stein (D, North Carolina) and Henry McMaster (R, South Carolina), issued a joint statement opposing the idea, saying there has been broad bipartisan consensus against offshore drilling because of, \"the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states.\" In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June, McMaster wrote, \"Every coastal municipality in South Carolina has passed a resolution opposing oil and gas exploration activities offshore. I stand firmly with them. We simply cannot afford to accept the risk of the adverse environmental impact attendant to offshore drilling.\" CBS News reached out to McMaster for comment, but his office did not respond. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who is running for governor of South Carolina, issued a similar letter to Burgum, writing, \"In South Carolina, there is widespread bipartisan agreement in opposing offshore drilling off the coast of our state.\" The Trump administration tried to open new offshore oil leases during his first term, but backtracked when Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina lawmakers from both parties criticized the effort. The Trump administration instituted bans on offshore drilling in waters surrounding those states shortly before the 2020 election. The current iteration of the plan does not include offshore oil leases off Florida\u0027s coast, but it is unclear whether those bans will continue off the Carolinas. CBS News reached out to the White House and Department of Interior for more information about the plans. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing policy discussions. The Biden administration issued a record low number of offshore oil leases, and withdrew 625 million acres along the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaska coasts from offshore oil development. The Trump administration rescinded those Biden withdrawals, and a federal court in Louisiana ruled this month that the Biden withdrawals were illegal. Offshore oil leases have been unpopular for decades. Congress had a moratorium preventing drilling on both coasts and the eastern Gulf from 1981 to 2008, and President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order preventing offshore drilling which stood until 2008, when his son lifted the order. The Obama administration had once considered opening the Atlantic coast to offshore oil leases but changed its stance following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. The Department of Interior is expected to publish its first proposal on the subject in the coming weeks. There will be two additional comment periods before a final plan is proposed and implemented.

Read Full Bio Nicole Sganga Updated on: October 24, 2025 / 8:41 PM EDT / CBS News The Trump administration has conducted 40 removal flights to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, deporting nearly 8,000 Venezuelan nationals since March, according to senior Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity. The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday\u0027s flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS. Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault. DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety. \"These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place,\" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January. McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump\u0027s second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported. According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia\u0027s Pacific coast. The most recent strike, conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela\u0027s Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was \"a lethal kinetic strike\" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. \"Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike … all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed,\" Hegseth said. Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas. The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, part of a buildup of U.S. forces in the region. The military maneuvers have drawn the Venezuelan government\u0027s ire. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered new military exercises last week, and he said he\u0027s prepared to declare a state of emergency earlier this month, accusing the U.S. of \"aggression.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez contributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

She is the principal of the Buffalo Academy of Science, a K-12 charter school in Buffalo, New York, and she kept telling people she wanted to invite the whole school. \"I definitely mentioned it multiple times,\" Lanoye told CBS News.

Earlier this month, just a few days before her actual wedding, the staff dressed Lanoye in a makeshift wedding dress and led her into the school courtyard. \"When I exited the building and saw all the students gathered there, I was blown away,\" Lanoye said. The couple in white stood before more than 400 students and staff. The students saw Lanoye and Klapp exchange vows and candy ring pops. And a student officiated the proceedings. No one in the audience objected to the union, but a few of the students joked with CBS News that Klapp is not Lanoye\u0027s one, true love. \"She couldn\u0027t stop smiling…She loves the kids more than her husband,\" student Sabahat Uddin said. When CBS News asked Lanoye to confirm or deny the allegations, she just laughed and said the ceremony was everything she could have wanted. \"I love my students more than anything,\" Lanoye said. \"And I just hope that our students feel as loved as I felt in that moment.\" In: Education Wedding New York © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Read Full Bio Julia Ingram Updated on: October 25, 2025 / 12:00 AM EDT / CBS News Dozens of executives and companies have donated to fund the construction of President Trump\u0027s $300 million ballroom, as many of them eye favorable policy, reduced scrutiny or approval for major deals from the White House. Donors to the ballroom — which will take the place of the White House\u0027s East Wing — include Big Tech companies, defense contractors and other large corporations. The White House has not disclosed how much money each company donated. Mr. Trump has said construction will be funded through private donations and his own money — not taxpayer funds. Speaking to reporters Friday night as he was departing for an Asia trip, Mr. Trump said that \"more than $350 million\" had been raised so far. CBS News reviewed a list of 37 donors provided by the White House, which included tech firms like Google and Amazon and crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. Others that contributed to the project include Nvidia, Susquehanna International Group and ExtremityCare, according to sources familiar with the matter. The president hosted a dinner last week thanking donors, although not everyone invited to the dinner contributed. Asked for comment on whether these donations present any conflicts, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement to CBS News: \"The same critics who are wrongly claiming there are conflicts of interests, would complain if taxpayers were footing the bill.\" \"The donors for the White House ballroom project represent a wide array of great American companies and generous individuals, all of whom are contributing to make the People\u0027s House better for generations to come,\" she added. Here\u0027s a closer look at what some of the donors and dinner guests stand to gain from federal policy or have already received from the administration. Big Tech and telecom Tech giants Google, Palantir, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as cell phone carrier T-Mobile, were among the donors listed by the White House. YouTube, owned by Google, agreed to pay $22 million toward the ballroom project as part of a legal settlement in a case Mr. Trump brought against the company for temporarily removing him from the platform after the 2021 Capitol riot. Software company Palantir has been awarded more than $800 million across several government contracts in fiscal year 2025, more than in any prior year, according to federal contract data. The Trump administration has also made Palantir a key player in managing and consolidating data about Americans between federal agencies, The New York Times reported. Amazon and Microsoft also have each received hundreds of millions in government contracts, federal data show. T-Mobile may stand to benefit from a Trump Organization-linked mobile phone and cell service company, something House Democrats have expressed conflict-of-interest concerns over. The company isn\u0027t run by the Trump Organization, but is licensing the president\u0027s name. The Trump Mobile network says it is run on Liberty Mobile Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator that rents bandwidth from major carriers like T-Mobile. In a statement to CBS News, a T-Mobile spokesperson said the company donated to the Trust for the National Mall, which is handling ballroom donations, but has \"no role in the use of those funds or decisions related to the construction of the ballroom.\" The spokesperson did not comment on the Trump-linked cell service company. Representatives from Nvidia, one of the world\u0027s leading developers of advanced microchips, were among dozens of donors invited to Mr. Trump\u0027s thank-you dinner, according to a guest list obtained by CBS News. The Trump administration granted Nvidia export licenses to send certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenues, as the company\u0027s CEO presses for greater access to the Chinese market. Nvidia is also waiting for the administration\u0027s full approval to ship hundreds of thousands of its artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates annually, though the administration gave the company permission to export to American businesses operating in the Gulf country earlier this month, according to Bloomberg. Jeff Yass, who cofounded the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and invested in TikTok, was also on the guest list. Yass has given more than $16 million to super PAC MAGA Inc. this year. In his first term, Mr. Trump sought to ban TikTok, but he reversed course this year, signing an order last month to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. with a slate of American investors. Meanwhile, Yass\u0027s wealth has surged by billions of dollars this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg and Forbes. Cryptocurrency Some of the biggest names in crypto also made donations to Mr. Trump\u0027s ballroom, according to the White House\u0027s list of donors. The Trump administration has vowed to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world,\" as the president\u0027s family has made billions on their own crypto ventures. A company spokesman confirmed Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, made a donation. The company is seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval to offer blockchain-based stocks. It also faces an SEC investigation started under former President Joe Biden into whether it misstated its user numbers in past financial disclosures, The New York Times reported. Earlier this year, the SEC withdrew a separate lawsuit against Coinbase, shortly after the company donated $1 million to Mr. Trump\u0027s inauguration. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who own crypto exchange Gemini, also helped pay for the event space. In February, the SEC closed a long-running investigation into their crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss announced on X, after the Winklevoss twins donated more than $2 million to MAGA Inc. one month prior. In July, the brothers successfully lobbied Mr. Trump to withdraw his original nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates crypto, according to Politico. The crypto company Ripple also donated. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has openly expressed his support for the current administration\u0027s cryptocurrency policies, and Mr. Trump has promoted its coin, XRP, as one of the coins that a planned U.S. government-controlled crypto reserve should include. Defense and federal contractors Lockheed Martin donated over $10 million to Mr. Trump\u0027s ballroom, according to company sources. The defense contractor is typically awarded tens of billions annually in federal contracts. Booz Allen Hamilton also made a donation to the president\u0027s event space. The consulting firm typically generates 98% of its annual revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, but it has suffered from the Trump administration\u0027s crackdown on federal spending. Its government contracts shrunk by 20% in the fiscal year 2025, and its stock price has plunged 46% since Mr. Trump\u0027s reelection. Media Comcast has expressed interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Bloomberg reported, but its merger would face federal scrutiny. The Department of Justice blocked a Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in 2015, because it would have made the conglomerate an \"unavoidable gatekeeper\" for Internet-based services. Comcast doesn\u0027t historically have the favor of the president; in April on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Comcast, which owns NBC and is spinning off MSNBC, a \"disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting.\" Medical Biotech company ExtremityCare\u0027s CEOs were on the thank-you dinner guest list. The company, which makes costly human cell and tissue medical products, previously donated $5 million to MAGA Inc. Soon after the donation, the Trump administration moved to delay a Biden administration plan to limit Medicare\u0027s coverage of the company\u0027s \"skin substitute\" bandages.

She previously worked at Bloomberg News and has written for national news outlets including USA Today and Consumer Reports. Read Full Bio Aimee Picchi Updated on: October 24, 2025 / 8:05 PM EDT / CBS News The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists\u0027 forecasts as the impact of President Trump\u0027s tariffs remain muted. By the numbers Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers. While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data. That\u0027s because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration\u0027s annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday. The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email. What economists say Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration\u0027s tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers. Still, companies are also passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers. \"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We\u0027re definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed\u0027s target\" of 2% annual inflation. Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue. Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending. What does the CPI mean for interest rates? The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed\u0027s decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today\u0027s inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday. \"There was little in today\u0027s benign CPI report to \u0027spook\u0027 the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week\u0027s Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\" Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire. That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed\u0027s dual mandate — to keep both inflation and unemployment low — in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation. \"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We\u0027ve been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\" Given the Fed\u0027s focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn\u0027t likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed\u0027s next meeting later this month, economists say. The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed\u0027s Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.
