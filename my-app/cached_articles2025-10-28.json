Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Congress has the constitutional power of the purse, but President Donald Trump’s robust assertion of executive authority is testing even that basic tenet of U.S. democracy. His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown. States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab. An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president’s spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful, could have the final word on at least some of them. The court’s conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration’s push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead: Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated. The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress. The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. “Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said. It’s hard to say how much money the administration has withheld Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress. Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That’s equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30. The administration has disputed that number. Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding, primarily in places represented by Democrats. The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say. “The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,” said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. “That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.” In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.” White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country’s massive debt. The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’” The administration has cut entire agencies The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding. The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender, race, immigration and other issues. But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs. Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies. Judges have raised constitutional concerns Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers by usurping Congress’ authority over spending. They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations. Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People’s Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration. The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House The high court’s conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department, freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health. Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings. In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations. The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts. In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions. That’s when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have time to act and the funds go unspent. Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch. Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again. ___ Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.

What has him and his fellow Brazilian farmers planting more soybeans is the trade war between the Trump administration and China that has shut American soybeans out of the massive Chinese market. China is actively seeking out Brazilian producers and the local trading companies that buy Rodrigues’ soybeans to sell to China have put the word out over the past two months that they will take all they can get, he said. Just how much China will buy from Brazil remains to be seen, but China’s customs body said it did not import any soybeans from the U.S. in September. It’s the first time that’s happened since November 2018 when President Donald Trump launched his first trade war with China. Brazilian beans already accounted for more than 70% of China’s imports last year while the U.S. share was down to 21% even before the current trade dispute began, World Bank data shows. Rodrigues, who chairs the soybean farmers association in Brazil’s powerhouse Sao Paulo state, is ramping up production at his Morada do Sol farm in the city of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo. The U.S.-China trade war “opens an opportunity for us here,” said Rodrigues, as he kicked off the highly mechanized process on his farm on a recent sunny day. “We need to be very aware in moments like this. Try to sell futures for the next harvest, seize this chance now.” Brazilian hope Brazil’s government said that between January and August, 77 million metric tons of soybeans were exported to China. That represents most of the South American country’s first season harvest. During that period, China imported 17 million metric tons from the U.S., according to China’s customs data. As the U.S. soybean harvest begins, there’s no indication that China is buying American. The number of cargo ships carrying U.S. grains and docking at a major Chinese grains port fell 56% between January and September this year over the same period the previous year, or from 72 to 32, according to a social media account of the state broadcaster China Central Television. The number has fallen to zero since July. By comparison, that port received an average of more than 40 cargo ships from countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay since May, and 90% of the cargo was soybeans, according to the state broadcaster’s post. “China comes to us because of prices. Whenever they have higher tariffs in a given country, they come to us,” said Rodrigues. The American Soybean Association said that China’s retaliatory tariffs on top of other taxes pushed the overall duties on U.S. soybeans to 34% in 2025, which has driven the price of American soybeans well above Brazil’s. Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry said in October it expected the next soybean harvest, the one that Rodrigues is planting now, to rise 3.6%, to almost 178 million metric tons in comparison with this year’s. Now, government analysts are reviewing those figures as China’s increased demand doesn’t show signs of waning. But Livio Ribeiro, a partner at consultancy BRCG and a researcher at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank and university in Rio de Janeiro, said the Chinese interest in Brazilian soybeans at this time of the year is a short-term move. “(China) is retaliating against the U.S. and doing it with two alternative potential suppliers,” Ribeiro said. Brazil has an edge over Argentina, because Lula is not ideologically aligned with the Trump administration like Argentina President Javier Milei, he added. “The West believed the U.S. was going to put its knee on China’s neck and that they would capitulate quickly,” Ribeiro said. “I think people understand now that this is not the game, because China has much more bargaining power.” American pain Kevin Cox said from his farm in Brazil, Indiana, that American farmers have to focus on selling more soybeans to other countries like South Korea and the Philippines while China isn’t buying and continue to invest in developing more uses for their crop at home like expanding production of biodiesel. He said when he traveled to China, buyers there told him that finding the lowest price was their priority. “China’s proved that they don’t have a problem buying them someplace else,” Cox said. The fear is that some farmers could go out of business as they deal with high costs and lower crop prices. But Minnesota farmer Glen Groth doesn’t think that will happen. He said “losing the Chinese market isn’t entirely unexpected nor is it seen as a complete catastrophe.” “Weather changes, politics changes, and you’ve just got to deal with it,” Groth said. Groth said he was able to sell his crop throughout the year at prices similar to last year with most of it floating down the Mississippi River about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from his farm. “We recognize that we’re going to be an adversary at worst with the Chinese and in a contentious relationship at best with the Chinese,” said Groth. Political muscle Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an ally of Chinese President Xi Jinping and has pushed for China to buy more Brazilian goods. But many soybean farmers like Rodrigues don’t care that Lula has stood up to Trump. They credit their own work for their success, not Brazilian diplomacy trying to expand markets for their products. And while farmers are excited by China’s interest at a time when they usually aren’t selling, an official from Brazil’s Industry and Trade Ministry cautioned that Beijing might wait before confirming purchases for the first half of 2026, because the price is higher now. That could be an incentive for Lula to seek other Asian buyers, said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Lula on Monday said he was confident his country and the U.S. would reach a trade deal, saying Trump practically guaranteed it when they met on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Malaysia on Sunday. The American president is also expected to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump, on board Air Force One Monday as he traveled to Japan, said “we feel good” about working things out with China. Rodrigues, the Brazilian farmer, says he doesn’t want ideology to be part of the debate on tariffs. “(American farmers) are being harmed and we have a temporary opportunity in Brazil. But let’s think more broadly. Growing and doing well while others are being harmed is not nice. There needs to be harmony,” Rodrigues said. ____ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo.

But make sure to get outside for some morning sun, too — it’ll help your body clock reset faster. Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time Sunday, which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed. Standard time will last until March 8 when we will again “spring forward” with the return of daylight saving time. There’s a lot of grumbling about the twice-a-year time changes. The spring switch tends to be harder, losing that hour of sleep we allegedly recover in the fall. But many people also mourn fall’s end of daylight saving time, when days already are getting shorter and moving the clocks can mean less daylight after school or work for exercise or outdoor fun. Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have long urged adopting standard time year-round. New research from Stanford University agrees, finding that switching back-and-forth is the worst option for our health. The study showed sticking with either time option would be a bit healthier, but they found permanent standard time is slightly better — because it aligns more with the sun and human biology, what’s called our circadian rhythm.

This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. More light in the morning and less at night is key to keeping that rhythm on schedule — all the instruments in sync. When the clock is regularly disrupted by time changes or other reasons, he said each of the body’s organ systems, such as the immune system or metabolism, “just works a little less well.” Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do — mostly in North America and Europe — the date that clocks are changed varies. In the U.S., Arizona and Hawaii don’t change and stay on standard time. Here’s what to know about the twice-yearly ritual. How the body reacts to light The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens. Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — whether from later time outdoors doing daylight saving time or from artificial light like computer screens — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism. How do time changes affect sleep? Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay the same. The spring change to daylight saving time can be a little rougher as darker mornings and lighter evenings make it harder to fall asleep on time. Those first few days have been linked to increases in car crashes and even an uptick in heart attacks. Some people with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle too. Many people easily adjust, like how they recover from jet lag after traveling. But a time change can add pressure on shift workers whose schedules already are out of sync with the sun, or those regularly sleep-deprived for other reasons. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don’t get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. How to prepare for the time change In both fall and spring, changing bedtimes by as little as 15 minutes a night in the days before the change can help ease into it. But sunshine in the morning is critical to helping reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. If you can’t get outdoors, sit by windows. Will the US ever get rid of the time change? In Congress, a bill named the Sunshine Protection Act that proposes making daylight saving time permanent has stalled in recent years. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House’s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin’s disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said. “Now she’s looking at two or three times the premium that she’s been paying for the insurance,” said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. “I’d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans’ plan is for health insurance?” Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn’t have a clear answer. “We think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,” he said, predicting Congress would “probably negotiate some off-ramp” later. His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare. President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they’ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year’s end — but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026. As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year’s midterm elections. “Premiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,” said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. “Premiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.” ‘Concepts of a plan’ At the center of the shutdown — now in its fourth week with no end in sight — is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended. Trump has long promised an alternative. “The cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it’s not good Healthcare,” he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. “I’m seriously looking at alternatives.” Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan.” But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, “I fully believe the president has a plan,” but didn’t go into details. Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they’ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won’t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown. A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected. House Speaker Mike Johnson told a press conference Monday that the tax credits are “subsidizing bad policy.” Republicans “have a long list of ideas” to address health care costs, he said, and are “grabbing the best ideas that we’ve had for years to put it on paper and make it work.” “We believe in the private sector and the free market and individual providers,” he added. A growing political issue With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls. In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that “government provided health care is the wrong path” and that “private health care is the right path.” In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse. Harris echoed a message shared by many in his party during his Maryland town hall, saying costs are “just going back to what it was like before COVID.” But the number of people who rely on Affordable Care Act health insurance has increased markedly since before the pandemic. More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF. Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without health care. “So how do you address that?” she asked. Moolenaar, who represents a district he handily won last year, responded: “We have time to negotiate, figure out a plan going forward and I think that’s something that could occur.” Some Republicans have shown urgent concern. In a letter sent to Johnson, a group of 13 battleground House Republicans wrote that the party must “immediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of health care affordability” once the shutdown ends. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” the lawmakers wrote. Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed. Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump’s first term to the GOP’s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they’re forecasting a similar outcome this time. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll. A looming internal GOP fight Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it’s clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension. “At least among Republicans, there’s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,” said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term. Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he’s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he’s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas “sooner than later.” David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has “urged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.” “We have a big spending problem,” McIntosh said. “I think most people are going to say, OK, I had a great deal during COVID,” he said. “But now it’s back to business as usual, and I should be paying for health care.” __ Swenson reported from New York.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW YORK (AP) — When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how to continue critical aid programs that could be funded by private donors. Multiple groups launched fundraisers in February and eventually, these emergency funds mobilized more than $125 million within eight months, a sum that while not nearly enough, was more than the organizers had ever imagined possible. In those early days, even with needs piling up, wealthy donors and private foundations grappled with how to respond. Of the thousands of programs the U.S. funded abroad, which ones could be saved and which would have the biggest impact if they continued? “We were fortunate enough to be in connection with and communication with some very strategic donors who understood quickly that the right answer for them was actually an answer for the field,” said Sasha Gallant, who led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that specialized in identifying programs that were both cost effective and impactful. Working outside of business hours or after they’d been fired, members of Gallant’s team and employees of USAID’s chief economist’s office pulled together a list that eventually included 80 programs they recommended to private donors. In September, Project Resource Optimization, as their effort came to be called, announced all of the programs had been funded, with more than $110 million mobilized in charitable grants. Other emergency funds raised at least an additional $15 million.

It’s possible private foundations and individual donors gave much more, but those gifts won’t be reported for many months. For the Trump administration, the closure of USAID was a cause for celebration. In July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency had little to show for itself since the end of the Cold War. “Development objectives have rarely been met, instability has often worsened, and anti-American sentiment has only grown,” Rubio said in a statement. Going forward, Rubio said the State Department will focus on providing trade and investment, not aid, and will negotiate agreements directly with countries, minimizing the involvement of nonprofits and contractors. Some new donors were motivated by the emergency Some private donations came from foundations, who decided to grant out more this year than they had planned and were willing to do so because they trusted PRO’s analysis, Gallant said. For example, the grantmaker GiveWell said it gave out $34 million to directly respond to the aid cuts, including $1.9 million to a program recommended by PRO.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Others were new donors, like Jacob and Annie Ma-Weaver, a San Francisco-based couple in their late-thirties who, through their work at a hedge fund and a major tech company respectively, had earned enough that they planned to eventually give away significant sums. Jacob Ma-Weaver said the U.S. aid cuts caused needless deaths and were shocking, but he also saw in the moment a chance to make a big difference. “It was an opportunity for us and one that I think motivated us to accelerate our lifetime giving plans, which were very vague and amorphous, into something tangible that we could do right now,” he said. The Ma-Weavers gave more than $1 million to projects selected by PRO and decided to speak publicly about their giving to encourage others to join them. “It’s actually very uncomfortable in our society —maybe it shouldn’t be — to tell the world that you’re giving away money,” Jacob Ma-Weaver said. “There’s almost this embarrassment of riches about it, quite literally.” Private donors could not support whole USAID programs The funds that PRO mobilized did not backfill USAID’s grants dollar for dollar. Instead, PRO’s team worked with the implementing organizations to pare down their budgets to only the most essential parts of the most impactful projects. For example, Helen Keller Intl ran multiple USAID-funded programs providing nutrition and treatment for neglected tropical diseases. All of those programs were eventually terminated, taking away almost a third of Helen Keller’s overall revenue. Shawn Baker, an executive vice president at Helen Keller, said as soon as it became clear that the U.S. funding was not coming back, they started to triage their programming. When PRO contacted them, he said they were able to provide a much smaller budget for private funders. Instead of the $7 million annual budget for a nutrition program in Nigeria, they proposed $1.5 million to keep it running. Another nonprofit, Village Enterprise, received $1.3 million through PRO to continue an antipoverty program in Rwanda that helps people start small businesses. But they were also able to raise $2 million from their own donors through a special fundraising appeal and drew on an unrestricted $7 million gift from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott that they’d received in 2023. The flexible funding allowed them to sustain their most essential programming during what CEO Dianne Calvi called seven months of uncertainty. That many organizations managed to hold on and keep programs running, even after significant funding cuts, was a surprise to the researchers at PRO. Since February, the small staff supporting PRO have extended their commitment to the project one month at a time, expecting that either donations would dry up or projects would no longer be viable. “That time that we were able to buy has been absolutely invaluable in our ability to reach more people who are interested in stepping in,” said Rob Rosenbaum, the team lead at PRO and a former USAID employee. He said they have taken a lot of pride in mobilizing donors who have not previously given to these causes. “To be able to convince somebody who might otherwise not spend this money at all or sit on it to move it into this field right now, that is the most important dollar that we can move,” he said. Other donors may wait to see what is next Dean Karlan, former USAID chief economist, poses at his home, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, in Evanston, Ill.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Not all private donors were eager to jump into the chasm created by the U.S. foreign aid cuts, which happened without any “rhyme or reason,” said Dean Karlan, the chief economist at USAID when the Trump administration took over in January. Despite the extraordinary mobilization of resources by some private funders, Karlan said, “You have to realize there’s also a fair amount of reluctance, rightly so, to clean up a mess that creates a moral hazard problem.” The uncertainty about what the U.S. will fund going forward is likely to continue for some time. The emergency funds offered a short term response from interested private funders, many of whom are now trying to support the development of whatever comes next. For Karlan, who is now a professor of economics at Northwestern University, it is painful to see the consequences of the aid cuts on recipient populations. He also resents the attacks on the motivations of aid workers in general. Nonetheless, he said many in the field want to see the administration rebuild a system that is efficient and targeted. But Karlan said, he hasn’t yet seen any steps, “that give us a glimpse of how serious they’re going to be in terms of actually spending money effectively.” Smaller donors also responded Other emergency funds used a different approach than Project Resource Optimization to respond to frozen foreign assistance. The group, Unlock Aid, which advocated for major reforms to the U.S. Agency for International Development before the cuts, launched their Foreign Aid Bridge Fund in mid-February and closed it at the end of April after raising $2 million from 400 donors and foundations. Their fund accepted applications while prioritizing frontline groups that had diverse revenue sources. They closed the fund after donations slowed and it became clear that the U.S. funding freeze would become a funding cut. Two other groups, Founders Pledge and The Life You Can Save, launched a joint Rapid Response Fund that raised $13 million. Their fund did not accept applications but worked closely with PRO to fund some of the programs they had identified. PRO also directed smaller donors to give through the Rapid Response Fund, which had the infrastructure to take both small and large gifts. In all, 1,300 individuals gave to the Rapid Response Fund, the groups said. Katrina Sill, the global health and development lead at Founders Pledge, said most of the 13 grants the fund made went to programs that benefit children. “This is a time to not forget [that] a very small amount of money can make an enormous impact,” she said. ____ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The three crew members of the MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter were rescued on Sunday afternoon, and the two aviators in the F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet ejected and were recovered safely, and all five “are safe and in stable condition,” the fleet said in a statement. The causes of the two crashes were under investigation, the statement said. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Tokyo on Monday, said the incidents could have been caused by “bad fuel.” He ruled out foul play and said there was “nothing to hide.” The USS Nimitz is returning to its home port in Naval Base Kitsap in Washington state after having been deployed to the Middle East for most of the summer as part of the U.S. response to attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. The carrier is on its final deployment before decommissioning. Another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, suffered a series of mishaps in recent months while deployed to the Middle East.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Brazil’s leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva expressed confidence on Monday that his country and the United States will reach a trade deal. U.S. President Donald Trump also signaled that a deal is likely. The statements came a day after the two presidents held talks on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, which Lula described as a “very good meeting.” Trump, who headed to Japan from Malaysia, also said he and Lula “had a great meeting” on Sunday. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Tokyo. “They’d like to do a deal.” Earlier, Trump had said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he had enacted in a push for leniency for Brazil’s imprisoned former president, a Trump ally. “I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” Trump had said after meeting Lula. According to Lula, he presented Trump with a written document outlining arguments against the U.S. tariff hikes that Lula said acknowledged the United States has the right to impose the measures, its move was based on “mistaken information.” Related Stories Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro appeals his 27-year prison sentence 2 MIN READ Brazilian farmers beef up soybean production as China halts business with US during trade fight 5 MIN READ Uncontacted Indigenous groups could vanish within a decade without stronger protections, experts say 6 MIN READ Trump didn’t commit to suspending the tariff hikes, nor raised any conditions during their talks, Lula said. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Follow on “He guaranteed to me that we will reach an agreement,” Lula told a news conference, speaking through an interpreter. “I am very confident that in a few days we will reach a solution.” The Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products in July on top of a 10% tariff hike earlier. The U.S. justified the tariffs saying that Brazil’s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency. Bolsonaro was recently convicted of attempting a coup after losing his bid for reelection in 2022 and a panel of Brazil’s Supreme Court sentenced him to about 27 years in prison. Lula said he again reminded Trump that Brazil was one of three Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations countries with which the U.S. maintains a trade surplus. The U.S. had a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau. He also noted that Bolsonaro had been given a fair trial, and that his case should not factor in their trade negotiations. “Bolsonaro is part of the past now in Brazilian history” he said. Lula said he also offered to help mediate the crisis in Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro has accused the U.S. of fabricating a war against him after Washington sent the world’s biggest warship towards his country. Lula, who marked his 80th birthday on Monday, said he felt at a high point of his life and that he hopes to live up to 120 years old. He was in Kuala Lumpur to attend annual summits held by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a guest of chair Malaysia, which hopes to deepen the region’s trade links with Latin America. From aboard Air Force One, the 79-year-old Trump also wished Lula a happy birthday, describing the Brazilian president as “a very vigorous guy.” “I was very impressed,” Trump said. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Megerian in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.","category":"","leftBias":0.34302858,"centerBias":0.3943437,"rightBias":0.26262772},{"title":"Chinese-made C919 jet hits snags as trade tensions disrupt parts supplies","url":"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-aircraft-trade-comac-8eaf0e9f235b989cd8100152bd5c3f66","sourceName":"Associated Press","publishedAt":"2025-10-27T06:40:45Z","description":"China\u0027s ambition to rival Boeing and Airbus with its homegrown C919 passenger jet is hitting turbulent skies.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit HONG KONG (AP) — China’s ambition to challenge Boeing and Airbus with its own homegrown passenger jet is running into turbulence, with deliveries of finished aircraft likely to fall far short of its target announced for this year. The C919 jet -- a single-aisle passenger plane aiming to rival Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320 – is made by state-owned aircraft manufacturer COMAC. Beijing is showcasing it as evidence of China’s technological advancement and progress in self-reliance, though it uses many Western sourced components. Trade friction with Washington threatens to prevent COMAC from securing core parts for the program that has been supported by huge Chinese government subsidies. “COMAC faces significant risk from the volatile policy environment, with its supply chains vulnerable to export restrictions and tit-for-tat measures between the U.S. and China,” said Max J. Zenglein, Asia-Pacific senior economist at The Conference Board think tank. The C919 has 48 major suppliers from the U.S. -- including GE, Honeywell and Collins -- 26 from Europe and 14 from China, according to analysts at the Bank of America. Trump threatened to impose new export controls on “critical” software to China after Beijing imposed stricter export controls on rare earths.

Follow on Beijing has high hopes for the C919, which made its maiden commercial flight in 2023. The mid-sized jet is meant to help fill vast domestic demand for new aircraft over the next few decades. China hopes to expand sales beyond its borders and fly globally, including in Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe. COMAC delivered 13 C919s to Chinese carriers last year and only seven as of October this year, despite plans to ramp up production and deliver 30 jets in 2025, according to the aviation consultancy Cirium. China’s biggest state-owned airlines -- Air China, China Eastern and China Southern -- are the only commercial airlines currently flying a total of around 20 C919s. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have “directly affected” delivery schedules for the C919, said Dan Taylor, head of consulting at aviation consultancy IBA. For one, output plans were disrupted when the U.S. suspended export licenses for the jet’s LEAP-1C engines around May, resuming them in July, he said. U.S.-controlled technology that needs export licensing for the LEAP-1C engines -- jointly built by the U.S.’s GE Aerospace and France’s Safran -— means the C919’s engines require U.S. export clearance, Taylor said, making it “inherently sensitive to political shifts.” “Engine and avionics dependence on Western suppliers continues to expose the program to policy decisions beyond COMAC’s control,” Taylor explained. Geopolitical tensions alone are not the only cause for slower than expected production of the C919s. The program has been “marked by caution and prioritizing quality and safety, so there also may be some operational reasons for the slower production ramp up,” said Zenglein from The Conference Board. While “it has always been the aim to reduce the reliance on foreign components as quickly as possible” for the C919, Zenglein said, many analysts say it is a challenging process. China’s own engine alternative -- the CJ-1000A under development by state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) -- is still under testing, according to IBA. Several airlines outside of China, including AirAsia, have expressed interest in flying the C919, but a lack of international certification has so far prevented the C919 from flying beyond China. Certifications from the U.S. and the European Union’s aviation regulators could take years. For the C919 to succeed, it “needs to have each one of three things: good economics, a prompt global product support network, and certification from safety agencies”, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. “Any one of these three alone doesn’t mean much,” he said. China will need 9,570 new passenger aircraft between 2025 and 2044, according to Airbus’ latest market forecast, more than 80% of them single-aisle jets like the C919. COMAC’s faces a growing challenge from Airbus, which is expanding its manufacturing capacity in China. A second assembly line is due to begin operating in 2026, allowing Airbus to increase its production of A320 single-aisle jets in China – an aircraft model similar to the C919. Analysts expect that it will take years for COMAC to break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in global aircraft share. By the late 2020s, COMAC will likely grow within China and possibly establish regional exports, said IBA’s Taylor. In the near term, a lack of international certification will be “delaying any meaningful Western-market entry” for the jet and export control volatility will likely continue to undermine its global expansion plans, Taylor added.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — LSU fired coach Brian Kelly during the fourth season of a 10-year contract worth about $100 million, athletic director Scott Woodward announced Sunday night. The move comes on the heels of Saturday night’s 49-25 loss to No. 3 Texas A\u0026M in Tiger Stadium — a second straight loss, and third in four games for LSU (5-3, 2-3 Southeastern Conference). “When Coach Kelly arrived at LSU four years ago, we had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge,” Woodward said. “Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize.” Associate head coach Frank Wilson, who also serves as a running backs coach, has been tapped as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2025 season. AP AUDIO: LSU fires coach Brian Kelly in the 4th season of his 10-year, $100 million deal One of the most notable coaches in college football has been relieved of duty. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports. Kelly was hired away from Notre Dame when his predecessor, Ed Orgeron, stepped down following the 2021 regular season. He has gone 34-14 with the Tigers, even taking LSU to the 2022 SEC title game. But LSU did not qualify for the College Football Playoff in his first three seasons, and was virtually eliminated from contention with its loss to the Aggies. Playing catch-up: Ohio State’s wealth of talent at WR has its Big Ten rivals trying to follow suit Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer ‘definitely evolving’ as win streak grows, and it’s contagious Michigan and coach Moore drop appeal of NCAA penalties from sign-stealing saga The playoff was expanded from four to 12 teams for the 2024 season. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. “I will not compromise in our pursuit of excellence and we will not lower our standards,” said Woodward, an LSU graduate who was hired to his current post in 2019, the same year the Tigers won their last national title under Orgeron. Orgeron left after not posting a winning record during his final two seasons. While Kelly did not coach LSU to a playoff berth, he oversaw quarterback Jayden Daniels’ development into a Heisman Trophy winner in 2023. “I am confident in our ability to bring to Baton Rouge an outstanding leader, teacher and coach, who fits our culture and community and who embraces the excellence that we demand,” Woodward said. LSU could have to pay Kelly more than $52 million to not coach through 2031, but the precise figure was unclear on Sunday night.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “We will continue to negotiate his separation and will work toward a path that is better for both parties,” Woodward said. The development is an awkward one for Woodward, who was Texas A\u0026M’s athletic director when that university hired Jimbo Fisher, only to have to buy him out for a historic $77 million after he struggled to win consistently during his six seasons there from 2018 to 2023. Kelly, 64, has coached in the top tier of Division I college football since being hired by Central Michigan in 2004. In the 22 years since, he has gone 200-76, including a 34-6 record at Cincinnati and a 113-40 record at Notre Dame. He was lured away from Notre Dame by Woodward, who saw Kelly as a coach who could win a national title if he had access to the resources at an SEC power like LSU, where the previous three coaches — Nick Saban, Les Miles and Orgeron — all had won national championships. But Kelly’s arrival at LSU also overlapped with a major paradigm shift in the sport: the advent of the transfer portal, which allowed players to more freely jump to different schools from year to year without having to sit out a season, and the approval to pay players for the use of their name, image and likeness. Last offseason, LSU launched a campaign to dramatically increase funding available to pay players, and the Tigers brought in numerous transfers to step into starting roles, particularly on the offensive line, defensive line and secondary. The Tigers also were able to lure 2024 starting quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, who was eligible for the NFL draft, to return for his senior season, further raising expectations that LSU would contend for a CFP berth. Instead, LSU not only has lost to Ole Miss, Vanderbilt and A\u0026M, but the three power conference teams the Tigers have beaten — Clemson, Florida and South Carolina — all currently have losing records. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Edward J. Markey Director Kathryn Bigelow’s new thriller, “A House of Dynamite,” is not simply a gripping film — it is a wake-up call. The movie dramatizes, in real time, the terrifying 30-minute window between the launch of a nuclear missile bound for the U.S. and its impact. In doing so, the film exposes a brutal truth that too many decision-makers and policy experts in Washington refuse to admit: Long-range missile defense will not protect us. Our only real path to escape nuclear catastrophe lies in reducing global arsenals. From the film’s first frames, Bigelow dispels the comforting illusion that technology can shield us from a nuclear attack. “A House of Dynamite” depicts U.S. ground-based interceptors launching and failing to stop the incoming missile. “So it’s a f---ing coin toss? That’s what $50 billion buys us?!” exclaims the frustrated secretary of defense, played by Jared Harris. The answer, in fact, is yes. In scripted tests, U.S. missile defenses against intercontinental weapons have succeeded only about 55 percent of the time — under ideal conditions, with known targets, no decoys and perfectly timed launches. Real war introduces deception, saturation attacks and human failures. The system is brittle. A “silver bullet” defense is a fantasy. Long-range defenses don’t work, and they make it harder to reduce the nuclear threats we face. The U.S. has spent hundreds of billions of dollars chasing long-range missile defense systems. Not one has delivered dependable protection. The bloated contracts persist, the well-connected lobbyists benefit and the public clings to hope. But the underlying logic is flawed: Long-range defenses don’t work, and they make it harder to reduce the nuclear threats we face. As our adversaries know, the best way to defeat our defenses is to build more offensive missiles. Rather than investing even more in the fool’s gold of missile defense, such as by spending trillions on President Donald Trump’s delusional Golden Dome, we need to focus on what works: arms reductions. Agreements such as the U.S.-Russian New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, have reduced nuclear arsenals about 90 percent and lowered the nuclear threat much more effectively than missile defense ever will. As the film points out, however, this decadeslong arms reduction effort is on life support: “At the end of the Cold War, nations reached consensus that we should have fewer nuclear weapons. That era is now over.” Tracy Letts on \u0027A House of Dynamite\u0027, \u0027Bug\u0027 and \u0027Mary Page Marlowe\u0027 06:12 New START is the last remaining U.S.-Russian arms reduction agreement. It will expire Feb. 5, 2026 — almost exactly 100 days from now — and it cannot be extended. These treaties can take years to negotiate, yet Washington and Moscow have not even started talks on a replacement. We need more time. Fortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered to adhere to New START limits for one year after the treaty expires, and President Trump’s initial response was positive. We must nail this down, and soon. We must freeze arsenals in place, not increase them. I recently urged the Trump administration to work with Russia to adhere to New START for another year and actively engage in talks on a successor treaty. If New START expires without commitments to stick to its limits, both the U.S. and Russia will be free to expand their strategic nuclear arsenals for the first time in decades, and a new nuclear arms race will loom. Some will argue deterrence has worked so far. But that is a fragile comfort. I have long pushed for policies for deep and verifiable reductions in nuclear arsenals — and I continue to believe that must be the North Star of U.S. strategy. We must reengage on arms control with not just Russia, but also China. We must revive diplomatic initiatives with North Korea, Iran and other nuclear aspirants. And we must constrain tactical stockpiles in Europe and Asia. The only nuclear defense worth believing in is disarmament — rooted in treaties, inspections and verification. Every warhead removed is one less we need to fear. Some will argue deterrence has worked so far. But that is a fragile comfort. We have been lucky. Mistakes, technical malfunctions, human error, miscalculation — each scenario could trigger nuclear disaster. “A House of Dynamite” dramatizes just one missile, but imagine dozens — perhaps hundreds — launched in coordination. The prospect becomes unthinkable. So let us not treat this film as mere entertainment. Let us heed it as testimony. “A House of Dynamite” reminds us that more nuclear weapons do not make us safer. We must stop acting as if we can build an impenetrable umbrella and instead treat the threat for what it is: an existential gamble we cannot afford. The real answer is not more technology, but fewer weapons. Sen. Edward J. Markey Edward J. Markey represents Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate.

You want me to use that term, too? So, look, let’s just get the language right. We are talking about undocumented individuals that are human beings. The last thing I’m going to do is accept that type of racist, nasty language to describe human beings.” To Johnson’s point about Africans brought against their will to the New World, it was only fairly recently that there was a concerted effort to refer to them not by the noun “slave,” but by the adjective “enslaved.” To say, for example, that slaves were imported from Africa, is to say “slaves” is all they were and had ever been. To say that they were “enslaved” is to describe what happened to them without reducing them to that condition. We’ve seen a similar push to describe people not as “prisoners,” but as “incarcerated” and, in the current matter, a push to say that even if laws have been violated, that doesn’t make “illegal” the right adjective to describe the people who violated them. In 2013, The Associated Press, which publishes a stylebook that most mainstream news organizations use, thought better of its previous guidance and steered journalists away from “illegal immigrant” and its variations “illegal alien,” “an illegal” and “illegals.” The AP said then that it “had in other areas been ridding the Stylebook of labels.” For example, it stopped using “schizophrenic” as a label in favor of saying someone has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 2013, The Associated Press steered journalists away from “illegal immigrant” and its variations. “And that discussion about labeling people, instead of behavior, led us back to ‘illegal immigrant’ again.” Journalists are encouraged to say someone entered the country illegally or illegally overstayed a visa. Therefore, “illegal immigration” is fine, but “illegal immigrant,” is not. Perhaps to Johnson’s chagrin, the AP doesn’t like “undocumented” either because, as it posted to social media in 2022, “Many immigrants and migrants have some sort of documents, but not the necessary ones.” Johnson has been both cheered by progressives and jeered by conservatives for dressing down the person who used “illegal alien,” and some have pointed out that the phrase has a legal meaning and therefore ought to be OK to use. But in the same way that people can, and do, object to the use of “homosexual” as a noun or “Black” as a noun, it’s not hard to understand why they might object to “illegal alien” and especially “illegal” as a noun. There are words and phrases that become understood as slurs, even if they didn’t necessarily originate as such. Jarvis DeBerry Jarvis DeBerry is an opinion editor for MSNBC Daily.

The union didn’t single out congressional Democrats in its condemnation — but that’s the party that’s going to feel the heat. “Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley said in the statement. “Today I’m making mine: It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today.” Democrats will feel more pressure this week. AFGE represents about 800,000 federal workers. During a shutdown, the federal government has to discontinue all services deemed nonessential, and many employees who continue to work don’t receive paychecks. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the shutdown has furloughed at least 670,000 federal employees, and 730,000 others continue to work without pay. AFGE symbolizes the collateral damage mounting as Democrats continue to demand that Republicans and President Donald Trump extend health-care subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of the year, in exchange for Democratic support for a government funding bill. The Democrats’ demands are defensible on a policy level — letting Affordable Care Act subsidies expire is yet another savage attack on Americans’ right to health care. But this principled position has costs. Many government services are shuttered, and the longer the shutdown continues, the worse things will get. The shutdown also imposes a heavy financial strain on not only the federal workers who are missing out on paychecks, but also their dependents — and the many others whose goods and services they can no longer afford. SNAP benefits at risk of being cut off for more than 40 million starting this weekend 09:47 If the shutdown extends into November — this weekend — the most immediate issue is the looming food stamps crisis. More than 40 million Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for food aid, but that support could vanish soon. Funding SNAP in November would require tapping into a contingency fund that experts say was designed for this kind of emergency. But U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said Monday that the agency can’t and won’t tap into the contingency fund, which they say is meant to support shortfalls in payments. My assessment is that this is a pressure tactic by the Trump administration. Democrats will feel more pressure this week for a few reasons. First, though Democrats are the minority party, just a handful of Democratic senators could end the shutdown if they vote with Senate Republicans for a continuing resolution. Second, historical trends suggest that over the long term, they could take a bigger hit in the polls than Republicans, although the jury is still out on that given how unusual the Trump era is. Third, Democrats consider themselves defenders of a functioning civil service and the social safety net — so there is only so much government dysfunction they can trigger without appearing to disregard their own values, no matter how just their cause may be.

It’s as if Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House has unleashed a band of inexperienced pigskin enthusiasts hoping to capitalize on their popularity to sweep themselves into office. Whether it’s due to a general climate of distrust toward politicians or favorable political circumstances (such as conservative-backed voter suppression efforts) in their respective district or state, several Republican neophytes from the world of football have thrown their helmets into the ring this year to run for office. Last week, former University of Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron announced his Republican candidacy for lieutenant governor of Alabama. Should he win, McCarron could end up serving under Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach and sitting U.S. senator who has chosen to run for governor next year instead of seeking re-election. Conservative sports commentator Paul Finebaum has said he’s considering getting into the Republican primary for the Senate seat that Tuberville is vacating. In Georgia, former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley is running in the GOP primary for Senate, competing for the chance to unseat Democrat Sen. Jon Ossoff. Dooley is following in the footsteps of running back Herschel Walker, who was defeated in 2022 by Sen. Raphael Warnock. And in Arizona, former NFL kicker-turned-broadcaster Jay Feely is running for Congress to serve in the staunchly conservative congressional seat that Rep. Andy Biggs is leaving as he vies to become governor. If elected, these men obviously won’t be the first to pivot from the gridiron to roles in government (or at least to make the attempt). Texas Democratic Senate candidate Collin Allred, who played briefly in the NFL, served in Congress, as did Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah. But MAGA’s hunger for candidates whose distinguishing characteristics are a recognizable name and a loyalty to the conservative cause may be part of the reason these athletes are jumping in, despite a near-total lack of political experience.

But you can’t call it a “work period” if you’re not working. Republicans have to know how bad this looks. You have federal employees, people in the military, air traffic controllers, who are working every day without pay — and then you have members of Congress, who haven’t set foot in Washington, D.C., in weeks, still collecting their paychecks. Any Republican who thinks that’s not a political problem has their head in the clouds. But the Republican Party’s problems don’t stop there. The U.S. Department of Agriculture now says that come Nov. 1, the 42 million Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not get their benefits. That doesn’t just affect Democrats; just like cuts to Medicaid, this will impact people in red and blue states alike. While thousands of federal employees continue to work without pay and millions of Americans are on the verge of losing much-needed benefits, Donald Trump isn’t focused on reopening the government or on forcing Republicans to come to the negotiating table. Instead, he’s destroying the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom and giving Argentina a $20 billion bailout. This is going to cost Republicans. With just over a week to go until Election Day in Virginia, the latest Washington Post-Schar School shows former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Make no mistake, in a state like Virginia, a government shutdown makes a difference. When you have Republicans running Washington and federal employees are not getting paid, that makes a huge difference. Voters know who’s at fault. It doesn’t matter if you have Republican members of the House and Senate running around yelling, “clean CR, clean CR.” Voters know which party has a monopoly on power in Washington, and they’re going to hold it accountable.

I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.” The rhetoric was predictably disconnected from reality. The Republican ticket’s performance with Hispanic voters had improved over his earlier races, but the assertion that it “set records” was absurd. Nevertheless, his comments suggested that Trump might at least try to be slightly less punitive toward the community in his second term. But with his aggressive mass deportation campaign specifically targeting Latino communities, the political impact was unavoidable. The Associated Press reported: President Donald Trump’s favorability has fallen among Hispanic adults since the beginning of the year, a new AP-NORC poll shows, a potential warning sign from a key constituency that helped secure his victory in the 2024 election. The October survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 25% of Hispanic adults have a ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ favorable view of Trump, down from 44% in an AP-NORC poll conducted just before the Republican took office for the second time. The Republican’s favorability among Hispanic voters hasn’t been this low since 2019, and there’s no reason to assume that trend line is going to turn around. The AP’s report on the data added that younger Hispanics and Hispanic men, who moved closer to Trump in the 2024 race, are also turning against the president: “About two-thirds of Hispanic adults under age 45 and Hispanic men now view Trump unfavorably, according to the new poll.” After Trump won a second term, there was considerable discussion about whether he was driving a political “realignment.” Over the past couple of decades, Hispanic voters have generally been seen as part of the Democratic coalition, but with Trump making significant gains, despite dehumanizing language toward immigrants during his 2024 candidacy, many observers speculated about a shift that would help Republicans enormously going forward.” It appears those assumptions are due for a reevaluation. “The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration has become a campaign of discrimination against Latinos,” the editorial board of The New York Times said in a newly published piece. “Federal agents are rounding up people with brown skin, catching both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants in their dragnet. Some Latinos are now afraid to speak Spanish or listen to Spanish music in public. Some are missing Mass and staying home on Sundays, or asking friends to pick up their children from school. American citizens are living in fear of a government that is sworn to protect their liberties and keep them safe.” It is a commitment the Republican White House appears to have fundamentally rejected.

That includes Jack Criss, who now drives for DoorDash on top of his job as an air traffic control specialist at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. As essential employees, air traffic controllers are mandated to work their normal schedules without compensation during a government shutdown. On Monday, Criss spoke to Chris Jansing about his decision to pick up extra work, explaining that as a single father, he felt he “didn’t have a choice.” “I have to do what I have to do in order to provide for my child,” Criss said. “She looks up to me for a high-level responsibility, and I take that responsibility very, very seriously.” During a news conference with House Republicans last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged that many air traffic controllers were being forced to make “choices” amid the shutdown, but he expressed concern about them taking on second jobs, noting the demanding work air traffic control requires. “Well, I don’t want my air traffic controllers to take a second job,” he said. “I want them to do one job. I don’t want them delivering for DoorDash, I don’t want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities and controlling the airspace.” Criss responded to Duffy’s comments, telling Jansing, “The FAA has always told us that family was first, so it’s kind of a contradiction to say not to do what you have to do to provide for your kid if we’re putting family first.” As an air traffic controller, Criss told Jansing that “safety is paramount” and that he’s learned to “compartmentalize” the stress so it doesn’t affect him at work. “You have to take your stress and shove it to the corner,” he said. “Can different people do that better than others? Sure. Will some people have slippage? Perhaps, but you’ll never hear me say, or anybody in this industry say, that safety is compromised. I will always stand on safety, and I will always promote a safety culture,” he said. Criss said that the shutdown has had an effect on his personal life and told Jansing that his daughter could see the toll it was taking on him. “It’s apparent to her that I am under more duress. She’s already expressed to me that I’m being shorter with her and that my patience is thinner, but she also has a decent and a very warm heart, so she understands.” You can watch Jansing’s full interview with Criss in the clip at the top of the page.

As odd and offensive as the rhetoric obviously was, it was made worse by Trump’s long struggle to understand the purpose of these exams. We’re talking about tests that are used to identify evidence of dementia, mental deterioration and neurodegenerative diseases. Those who take them may be asked, for example, to draw a clock or describe the similarities between oranges and bananas. Trump has somehow convinced himself, however, that they’re akin to Mensa exams and that the results are proof of his genius. (His “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” boast remains the stuff of legend.) As part of the same Q\u0026A, another follow-up question stood out: “The readout from Walter Reed mentioned ‘advanced medical imaging,’” a reporter noted. “Did you get an MRI?” The New York Times highlighted his response: President Trump said that he underwent magnetic resonance imaging earlier this month, telling reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday that the results had been ‘perfect’ but declining to say why his doctors had ordered the scan. The issue has been lingering a bit in the background in recent weeks, following Trump’s Oct. 10 visit to Walter Reed for his second physical of the year. Soon after, an official White House summary released to news organizations noted that he underwent “advanced imaging” as part of that visit. Last week, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about the MRI. The president’s chief spokesperson said MRIs are routine during medical exams (that doesn’t appear to be altogether true), though Leavitt conceded that she didn’t know why this specific test was ordered. This week, Trump advanced the story by acknowledging the MRI but hedging on any details, despite his frequent boasts about transparency. The Republican specifically told reporters they could “ask the doctors” about the MRI, adding, “I think they gave you a very conclusive — nobody has ever given you reports like I gave you.” But that wasn’t quite right, either. For one thing, the recent White House readout didn’t explain the reason for the MRI. For another, that Trump has somehow created a new standard for excellence when it comes to presidential medical transparency is plainly contradicted by his record. Without more information, it’s difficult to speculate about what (if anything) this story will amount to, though we probably haven’t heard the last of this line of questions. Watch this space.

Mike Braun announced Monday he will open a special legislative session to vote on whether to conduct a mid-decade gerrymander of his state’s districts to shore up Republicans’ electoral chances ahead of next year’s midterms. Although the Trump administration kicked off the mid-decade redistricting race when it pressured Texas to find five more seats for Republicans, Braun’s announcement falsely casts the potential gerrymander in Indiana as a responsive effort “to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.” After Texas signed off on racist maps that water down Black and Latino voting power, California Democrats responded by putting a ballot measure before its voters that, if approved, would permit redistricting that would give Democrats an advantage. After Missouri and North Carolina distorted their maps, Democrats in Virginia and Maryland have signaled interest in redrawing their maps, as well, to combat the Trump administration’s power grab. Despite direct pressure from President Donald Trump and multiple trips to the state by Vice President JD Vance, some Indiana Republicans are reluctant to carve up the congressional districts. After Braun’s statement, the state Senate leader said Republicans still don’t have the votes, according to Politico reporter Adam Wren, who suggested last week that there are signs some fence-riders could come around. Braun’s announcement comes amid an ongoing pressure campaign from conservative influencers, who in some cases have promoted circulating the names, phone numbers and email addresses of the holdouts on the assumption that outraged messages will spur these lawmakers to get on board.

During his remarks, he referred to his late aunt, whom he said had stopped taking the subway after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, because she felt unsafe wearing her hijab. Vance then reposted a video of Mamdani’s address on X, writing, “According to Zohran, the real victim of 9/11 was his auntie who got some (allegedly) bad looks.” During an exclusive one-on-one interview with Ayman Mohyeldin on Saturday’s “The Weekend: Primetime,” the democratic socialist said the vice president was attempting “to pit people’s humanity against each other.” “This is all the Republican Party has to offer,” Mamdani told Mohyeldin. “Cheap jokes about Islamophobia, so as to not have to recognize what people are living through.” Mamdani’s Friday address came shortly after one of his opponents, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, laughed along as a conservative radio host joked that Mamdani would cheer on another Sept. 11–style attack. “Whether it’s JD Vance or it’s Andrew Cuomo, it is the same kind of politics,” Mamdani said. “It’s a politics of division. The reason that I called Andrew Cuomo Donald Trump’s puppet is not just because they share the same billionaire donors. It’s not just because they see themselves in each other. It’s also because their vision of leading a city, or a country, is one where you are only able to build a constituency by pitting it against another one, and that’s what we’re seeing in this moment.” He said the comments give people “a glimpse into reality for Muslims across the city each and every day.” Mamdani said that throughout the campaign, his religion has been used by his opponents to “terrify New Yorkers as to the prospect of having a Muslim mayor,” and that Friday’s speech came about after he “decided that it was simply too much.” “It was too much to think of these as the acts of desperate men looking to salvage the little power that they still had,” Mamdani continued. “It was, in fact, a reflection of Islamophobia within our political system that has become so endemic that when we hear it, we do not know from which party it comes. We just know that it is a fact of life in our city’s politics.” Mamdani said he chose to address the comments head-on because “if we do not allow ourselves to be shocked by this kind of racism, then we are, in fact, accepting it as a fact of life, and that is something that I will never accept.” You can watch Mohyeldin’s full interview with Mamdani in the clip at the top of the page.

The American Federation of Government Employees’ statement Monday will likely put pressure on Democratic lawmakers, a majority of whom oppose the bill, which would fund the government temporarily until Nov. 21. The House passed Republicans’ bill in September, but Senate Democrats have repeatedly blocked it, seeking guarantees that the GOP will renew health care tax credits that are set to expire. As a result of the standoff, federal employees have missed paychecks or are furloughed. Federal workers would typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but the gap has left many strained, AFGE National President Everett Kelley said. “These are patriotic Americans — parents, caregivers, and veterans — forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington,” AFGE’s statement said. \"That is unacceptable.\" The federal government officially shut down after Congress failed to reach a funding agreement before the start of the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.

It’s legally irrelevant whether prosecutors think they have a better chance at getting a conviction in one federal district over another, or if they’re worried about drawing a bad judge in a particular federal district. As we know, Smith drew U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who predictably handled the case in bizarre ways that favored Trump (who appointed her to the bench). She ultimately dismissed the case on the questionable ground of Smith being unlawfully appointed. We now have notable new reporting from MSNBC’s Carol Leonnig on internal dissension within Smith’s prosecutorial team over the geographical move. “Smith’s decision to bring the documents case in Florida, rooted in an extensive internal legal analysis, ran counter to what [federal prosecutor David] Raskin and others believed was the surer path to a conviction: charging Trump in D.C.,” reported Leonnig and co-author Aaron Davis in The Washington Post on Monday, based on interviews for their new book, “Injustice.” They reported: “Whether the law favored going to Florida or not, Raskin told teammates, they first had to ensure their case had the best chance of being heard by someone impartial. Given what the prosecution team saw as her track record of disregarding precedent, Cannon getting the case was too enormous a risk to ignore, he said.” Cannon getting the case did turn out to be a risk, to say the least. But it wasn’t really a question of “Did the special counsel want Cannon or not?” (obviously not) but rather “What does the law require?” On that score, Leonnig and Davis report that Smith and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland (who appointed Smith) “were convinced the legal analysis showed the best case was in Florida.” Given Cannon’s handling of the case and the looming question throughout her assignment of whether Smith could force her out, Leonnig and Davis’ reporting is further notable in relaying that Smith pitched the idea of seeking Cannon’s removal to then-Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar (like Garland, appointed by former President Joe Biden), who approved Smith’s plan to appeal Cannon’s dismissal of the case but rejected his bid to seek her removal. That decision by Prelogar is not surprising. As I explained at the time, it would be more challenging than it might seem to remove Cannon from the case. Third parties weighed in at the federal appeals court seeking Cannon’s removal, so the issue was presented to the appellate court in Smith’s appeal. In any event, he withdrew the appeal of Cannon’s dismissal order after Trump won the 2024 presidential election, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. We don’t know how the case would have turned out if Smith had brought it in Washington instead of Florida. He likely would have drawn a judge who would’ve let the case proceed more typically, though that shakier venue in D.C. could’ve given Trump a legal avenue to attack the case, so it could’ve been for naught. It wasn’t for a lack of aggression on Smith’s part, if that aggression would’ve been the legal equivalent of speeding off a cliff. At any rate, both that choice of venue and the broader Biden DOJ’s decision not to press for Cannon’s removal bolster the rule of law and the values that Trump and his DOJ have been busy trashing while claiming “weaponization” of the law by the prior administration.

But as it turns out, there’s another group of people who will be monitoring the process in an entirely different way. The Associated Press reported: The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties. The DOJ announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The Justice Department approved the monitoring of polling sites, not in response to a specific problem or evidence of irregularities, but in response to requests from state Republican Party officials. It’s important to emphasize that DOJ election monitoring is not altogether uncommon, but there is a broader context to consider. A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, told The New York Times, “This administration has made no secret of its goal to undermine free and fair elections. Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote.” Those concerns were bolstered two days later, when Donald Trump, without a shred of evidence, claimed via his social media platform that balloting in California is “totally dishonest.” And while such accusations are obviously ridiculous, consider the related data points from recent weeks: At the White House’s behest, Republicans in some states are engaging in brazen gerrymandering, using mid-decade redistricting to win congressional races before they happen. The Justice Department is fighting to acquire voter registration lists and election data in several states for reasons that still haven’t been explained. The Republican administration has chosen election deniers to serve in key federal election roles, leading The New York Times to note that conspiracy theorists “who worked to destabilize and discredit election results after 2020” will now have “the power to potentially interfere with future contests.” Trump is lobbying for the total elimination of early voting. He’s also lobbying for the total elimination of mail-in balloting. He’s also lobbying for the imposition of new and unnecessary voter ID laws that would further suppress the vote. In isolation, each of these stories matters, but taken together, we’re talking about what appears to be a multifaceted campaign against elections, launched by a president whose contempt for the democratic process is unsubtle. With a year remaining before the 2026 midterm elections, there is every reason to believe this offensive will only get worse in the coming months.

To the surprise of no one, the discussion proved pointless, and the shutdown soon followed. But during that ill-fated conversation, something weird happened: Participants noticed that red hats suddenly appeared on the president’s desk. The text on the hats read “Trump 2028.” In the immediate aftermath, the president started publishing assorted images to his social media platform in apparent celebration of the hats and their message. In one especially jarring instance, the Republican posted an AI-generated video of Trump tossing a “Trump 2028” cap onto the head of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. All of this was ridiculous, of course, but it was also a reminder that the president apparently likes to stoke the underlying rhetorical fire from time to time, as if another reelection bid were still a possibility for him — the Constitution be damned. A month later, he’s leaning into the idea anew. Reuters reported: U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out running for vice president in the 2028 election but declined to definitively say he would not seek a third term, keeping alive speculation about how he might seek to extend his time in office. The Republican called the idea of running for vice president “too cute,” adding that voters “wouldn’t like that,” but he was far less definitive about the broader issue. After claiming he hasn’t “thought about” the 2028 race, the Republican said he has “the best poll numbers” he’s ever had, concluding, “I would love to do it.” His claim about not having thought about the issue was obviously silly — the hats were a dead giveaway — and the idea that his public standing is at an all-time high is demonstrably absurd. But when Trump said he’d “love” to run again, that was believable. In March, the president told NBC News that he was “not joking” about pursuing a possible third term. Two months later, he addressed U.S. troops stationed at the Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, and declared, “As you know, we won three elections, OK? And some people want us to do a fourth. I don’t know, I’ll have to think about that.” There was — and is — nothing to think about. What Trump keeps referring to is plainly not legal. The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” The incumbent Republican and some of his allies continue to suggest that there’s some hidden wiggle room in that phrasing, but legal scholars know better. What’s more, the public isn’t exactly clamoring for the idea: A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted earlier this year found that 80% of Americans do not want Trump to serve a third term. I won’t pretend to know where this is headed or the degree to which the president is prepared to defy the Constitution, but Scott Cummings, a professor of legal ethics at the UCLA School of Law, made a comment on “The Rachel Maddow Show” in March that stood out for me. Commenting on autocracies around the world that have consolidated power, Cummings noted that in none of these countries “do leaders do all the things that Trump is doing, take aim at all of these independent institutions, and then just walk away.” Rather, the professor added, authoritarians take these steps because they intend “to stay in power permanently.” This post updates our related earlier coverage.

How could Donald Trump sell them out just as they’re finally making good profits on their beef? Doesn’t he love farmers and ranchers and everyone in rural America? In recent days, the president has made clear the answer — his feelings toward ranchers aren’t “love.” Last week, the president floated the idea of buying more beef from Argentina, and within days the administration released a plan to quadruple Argentinian beef imports. The goal, Trump said, was to “bring our beef prices down,” but the plan neatly dovetails with Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s efforts to boost the political fortunes of Trump ally Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, an effort that includes $40 billion in financial assistance to bail out Argentina’s financial markets. Everyone who buys beef has noticed how dramatically prices have risen in the last few years. Not surprisingly, America’s cattle ranchers didn’t react too well; some recorded videos from their ranches, saying that even though they love Trump, this plan will hurt them at a critical moment for their industry. Even some Republicans from farm states, so wary of crossing the president on anything, have raised objections. We all know how well Trump reacts to being told he’s wrong. In response to the criticism, he scolded them on Truth Social, posting, “The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil. If it weren’t for me, they would be doing just as they’ve done for the past 20 years — Terrible! It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” The ranchers are like Lando Calrissian in “The Empire Strikes Back,” protesting that he had a deal with Darth Vader. “I am altering the deal,” Vader responds. “Pray I do not alter it any further.” At that point, Lando knows he’s been played. It’s unclear if the ranchers have been clued in. “We’re all feeling it”: Wisconsin Lawmaker slams Trump over Argentine beef import, tariffs 06:26 Everyone who buys beef has noticed how dramatically prices have risen in the last few years. Just since Trump took office in January, the price of ground chuck is up by 20%. The reasons why are not complicated: It’s a simple matter of supply and demand. After years of drought, the size of the national cattle herd fell. Then, as Trump admits in the Truth Social post, “because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,” foreign imports fell. Imports from Mexico were also suspended entirely earlier this year after an infestation of screwworm. Yet Americans keep buying more beef. Higher demand plus lower supply equals higher prices. That’s great for cattle ranchers, who say they’re finally making good profits after several lean years. But it’s not so great for consumers. The ranchers ought to ask themselves why they ever thought Trump cared about them in the first place. If the price of beef were all that’s going up, it wouldn’t be such a political problem. But inflation data released on Friday showed the annual rate of inflation increasing to 3%. Electricity bills are rising. Millions of Americans are about to see dramatic spikes in their health insurance premiums, both those who buy their insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and those with employer-provided insurance. More car owners are struggling to make their payments. Consumer sentiment is positively dreadful. You can bet Trump knows this, especially because during the 2024 campaign he repeatedly promised that as soon as he was elected, prices would plummet (“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day 1”). Within the last month, as MSNBC’s Steve Benen noted Friday, Trump has claimed to have “successfully ‘defeated,’ ‘cured’ and ‘solved’ inflation.” He probably also knows that Americans give him lower ratings on handling the cost of living than on any other issue. If you want to know how quickly inflation can torpedo a presidency, just ask Joe Biden. To be fair to Trump, there’s no way he can simultaneously satisfy the ranchers, who want beef prices to stay high, and the rest of us, who want to spend as little as possible at the grocery store. But the ranchers ought to ask themselves why they ever thought Trump cared about them in the first place. \u0027Where\u0027s the beef?\u0027: Hosts respond to Trump\u0027s plan to import beef from Argentina 04:58 It’s the same issue that farmers are now confronting, after Trump’s ruinous trade war has — just as anyone who knows anything about agricultural trade predicted — devastated the soybean industry. Now farmers are left waiting for a bailout. Given all that, one would think there’s an opening for Democrats to make a case to ranchers, farmers and everyone else in rural America. If Democrats had the guts (which they probably don’t), they could start by telling those rural folk an uncomfortable truth: You thought Trump loved you, and you gave him your votes. But you got nothing in return, as surely as any enrollee in Trump University. He was always going to sell you out the moment it was in his interest, and that’s just what’s happening now. The question isn’t how many farmers and ranchers will vote for Democrats, because they’re a tiny portion of the population. According to government data, fewer than a million and a half Americans farm as their primary occupation, or less than one-half of 1% of the population. But rural America writ large is central to Trump’s coalition, and Democrats tiptoe around those voters, desperate to show they’re listening and they care. They’d get a lot farther if they began their argument by saying “the Republicans you’ve been voting for up and down the ballot, starting with Trump? They take your votes for granted and make your lives worse in return.” Last week, Trump posted an AI-generated video on social media portraying himself dumping excrement on Americans who live in cities. He didn’t post another one showing him doing the same to ranchers and farmers, but he might as well have, for all he actually cares about them. And his opponents shouldn’t be shy about reminding rural Americans exactly what Trump thinks of them.

Reflecting on the conversation, the president added, “I said, ‘Look, we’re not going to need it.’” Nine days after sharing the anecdote, the story changed: The “very wealthy person” didn’t just offer to pay, in the revised version, he actually did pay. Reuters reported: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a wealthy private donor has provided $130 million to the U.S. government to cover potential shortfalls in military salaries caused by the ongoing government shutdown. Speaking at a White House event, Trump praised the wealthy donor as a patriot and a ‘friend of mine,’ but declined to name him. “Today, he sent us a check for $130 million,” the president boasted on Thursday afternoon. “It’s gonna go to the military.” At the time, I more or less assumed that the claim was entirely made up. After all, the president routinely shares the details of conversations that have only occurred in his overactive imagination. But the administration spent Friday insisting that this was all quite real and that the Pentagon had actually accepted a $130 million check from an unnamed donor. (The New York Times reported that the person in question was Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and Republican megadonor, but this detail has not been independently verified by MSNBC.) While some skepticism is still in order, if the story is true, it’s a problem in ways that might not be immediately obvious. Right off the bat, there are practical considerations: The U.S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year to pay service members. While normal people would understandably see $130 million as an enormous amount of money, the arithmetic shows that in a situation like this, such a check would likely cover the troops’ compensation for less than a single day. Just as notably, there are broader political principles related to our system of government and how it’s supposed to work. In the U.S., it falls to Americans to pay for our military. When those responsibilities shift to the president’s private pals, the result creates an untenable dynamic. It necessarily creates a power imbalance, in which the public matters less and wealthy interests close to the Oval Office matter more. But perhaps most important of all is the fact that such a dynamic might very well be illegal. The New York Times reported, “The move to pay the troops with private donations is highly unusual and a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending money in excess of congressional appropriations or from accepting voluntary services.” For all intents and purposes, the list of ways in which federal agencies can spend money is quite limited: Congress can approve appropriations. See Point No. 1. In Donald Trump’s administration, however, there appears to be a near-constant search for alternative pools of money, either through tariffs and the resulting revenue, or through private donations for projects like the president’s ballroom vanity project.

The commercial wasn’t especially provocative — it noted former President Ronald Reagan’s concerns about trade tariffs — but it apparently triggered the incumbent American president, who falsely accused our neighbors to the north of launching a “fraudulent” and “illegal” scheme to sway Supreme Court justices. None of this made any sense at all, but on Friday, the Republican kept the offensive going. “They cheated on a commercial,” he said, referring to the Canadians, adding, “I guess it was AI or something. They cheated badly. Canada got caught cheating on a commercial, can you believe it?” In context, this was a rhetorical question, but for the record, the answer was “No, I can’t believe it, because none of these claims are true.” (The spot correctly reflected that Reagan defended free trade, though in the same set of remarks, the Republican explained his decision to impose duties on Japanese goods. At no point did Ontario’s ad rely on artificial intelligence.) A day later, Trump went considerably further. The New York Times reported: President Trump doubled down on Saturday in his feud with Canada over a television ad that used audio of former President Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs, saying he would punish the country with an additional 10 percent tariff on its goods. The commercial in question has already been pulled from the air, but according to the president, it wasn’t taken down fast enough, which in turn justifies a new round of trade tariffs. As the dust settles on this bizarre series of events, there’s a temptation to explain recent history and point to the unambiguous evidence that Reagan did not, in reality, love tariffs (no matter how many times Trump claims the contrary). There’s a related temptation to note that the Trump White House, just months ago, acknowledged that Trump’s views on the issue were plainly at odds with Reagan’s, despite the incumbent’s latest protestations. But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: An increasingly erratic president just unilaterally imposed economic penalties on one of the United States’ closest allies and key trading partners because a television commercial — which was accurate and is no longer airing — hurt his feelings. For his part, it fell to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to try to defend these ridiculous developments. On CBS’s “Face the Nation,” the Cabinet secretary insisted the ad constituted “interference” in “sovereign matters.” I can appreciate why this is a difficult policy to defend, but Bessent probably should’ve come up with better talking points. For one thing, there was nothing wrong with the ad. For another, Trump’s tariffs affect other countries, and it’s tough to blame them for pushing back. But even if we put those relevant details aside, Trump spent much of the year arguing that Canada should abandon its national status and become part of the U.S. If there’s going to be a conversation about “interfering” in “sovereign matters,” it’s hardly unreasonable to argue that Ottawa enjoys the high ground.

As part of a weird and discredited conspiracy theory, the president spun a ridiculous tale about Wray having lied about imaginary FBI agents who participated in the Jan. 6 attack. Though none of this made any sense, the Republican told NBC News a day later that he believed Wray engaged in “inappropriate” behavior during his tenure at the bureau and said he “would think” the Justice Department is investigating him. “I would imagine. I would certainly imagine. I would think they are doing that,” Trump said when he was asked whether the Justice Department should investigate Wray. A month later, the president was even less subtle. The New York Times reported: Trump called for prosecution of former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray, among others, in a rant on his social media platform on Friday night — replete with misinformation and debunked lies about the 2020 election. Trump, seizing on the release of documents showing the Biden Justice Department requested metadata on calls between the White House and Republican senators during the investigation into Trump’s attempt to overturn the election, claimed without evidence that the department ‘taped’ the calls. For reasons unknown, Trump, while presumably focused on his trip to Asia, published an absurd online tirade about newly disclosed “documents” that don’t appear to exist. As part of the same harangue, the president claimed there’s now “conclusive” evidence against Wray, former special counsel Jack Smith, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. According to Trump, the quartet “spied on” members of Congress (which never happened in reality), “taped” the lawmakers’ phone calls (which also never happened in reality) and “cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election” (which was not rigged). The post concluded, “These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!” None of these people are “radical left lunatics”; three of the four weren’t in office on Election Day 2020 and couldn’t have “rigged” anything; and there is literally no evidence of any of them engaging in “illegal” or “unethical” behavior. Trump’s hysterics, in other words, reflect the perspective of someone living in an alternate reality. But while the broader conversation about the president’s cognitive state continues to have merit, what I cared most about was his “should be prosecuted” phrase. Nine days before publishing this nonsense, during an event in the Oval Office, the president pressed the nation’s three most powerful federal law enforcement officials — the incumbent attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the director of the FBI — to prosecute Smith, Monaco and former FBI general counsel Andrew Weissmann. For good measure, the president soon after added, in reference to Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, “I hope they’re looking at ‘Shifty’ Schiff. I hope they’re looking at all these people,” before also endorsing a federal investigation into his election defeat in Georgia five years ago. Weeks earlier, Trump posted an item to his online platform that directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to go after three of the president’s perceived political enemies, whom he said were “guilty as hell” of unidentified crimes. As is always the case, while focusing on those in the White House, it’s important to watch what they do, not just what they say. The trouble in this instance, however, is that officials in Trump’s Justice Department have a scandalous habit of launching investigations — and in some cases, even securing dubious indictments — targeting those on the president’s growing enemies list. In other words, when Trump barks orders about those he wants to see prosecuted, there’s a team of presidential appointees who take these outlandish directives seriously, which makes them harder to simply brush off as meaningless palaver.

Cohen, MSNBC Columnist In June, Texas Republicans announced a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts. The goal was clear: flip as many as five Democratic-held seats in the House of Representatives to the GOP. That revision, which was enacted in August, is already transforming American politics — and decidedly for the worse. Red and blue states are engaged in a redistricting arms race that risks creating, in effect, one-party red and blue states and further sharpening the country’s partisan divides. The latest state to jump on the redistricting bandwagon is Virginia, where state Democratic leaders are considering a plan to amend the state’s constitution to allow for redistricting that could potentially flip two to three House seats from red to blue. A redistricting race to the bottom will create more and more one-party states, with little to no federal representation from a rival political party. This move comes on the heels of Missouri Republicans revising their congressional map to target the district held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. In North Carolina, already one of the most heavily gerrymandered states in the country, state Republicans passed legislation redrawing the state’s congressional map to potentially flip one House seat from blue to red. California voters appear poised to pass a referendum that would amend the state constitution to allow mid-decade redistricting. The move, made in direct response to Texas’ redistricting, could flip as many as five or six Republican-held seats to Democrats. Other redistricting efforts by Republicans in Florida, Louisiana and Kansas, and by Democrats in Maryland and Illinois, are also under consideration. Ohio is already required to redraw the state’s congressional maps, which will likely give the GOP a boost of one to three seats. A plan to redraw maps in Indiana, pushed heavily by the White House, is in jeopardy because Republicans in the state legislature are balking. The irony of all these partisan machinations is that if Democrats are successful in California and Virginia, it would likely cancel out the GOP’s redistricting efforts, or ensure that Republican efforts yield only a handful of potential flips. But Texas’ gambit is already opening the floodgates to even greater partisan redistricting. For example, in both Virginia and California, Democrats are seeking to undo their party’s previous good-government initiatives. In 2008 and 2010, Californians voted to create an independent redistricting commission to redraw congressional maps. In 2020, Virginia voters approved an amendment to the state constitution creating a nonpartisan redistricting commission. Both had strong Democratic support. But Texas’ brazen redistricting effort led Democrats in both states to scrap those plans and pursue partisan redistricting. Government shutdown continues as lawmakers remain at funding impasse 08:30 And other states may soon follow suit. In New York, Democrats are discussing plans to amend the state constitution to allow mid-decade redistricting that would take effect by the 2028 midterms. In Colorado, Democrats are floating the idea of amending the state constitution to allow emergency redistricting in 2028. Such a move could shift three to four seats from red to blue. Democrats in New Jersey, Michigan, Minnesota, or Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (if Democrats take control of the legislatures in the latter two states) could face similar partisan pressure to abandon independent redistricting commissions. All this maneuvering is the logical outcome of the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision allowing partisan redistricting to go forward. The Court ruled that while partisan gerrymandering may be “incompatible with democratic principles,” it was not an issue that federal courts could remedy. The Court’s decision was akin to handing a 16-year-old the keys to a sports car. Once Republicans were given the chance to redraw maps that benefited their members, they were more than eager to take the wheel. While Democrats pursued nonpartisan redistricting commissions, Republicans saw a political opportunity. Indeed, Democrats at the federal level offered a legislative off-ramp from this intensifying political arms race: the For the People Act, which would ban partisan gerrymandering and require independent redistricting commissions in every state. This legislation, which passed the House in 2019 and 2021, has been filibustered by Senate Republicans. If Democrats are successful in California and Virginia, it would likely cancel out the GOP’s redistricting efforts, or only yield Republicans a handful of potential flips. The Supreme Court would add insult to injury if it moves to further dismember Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which allows for the creation of majority-Black districts in Southern states. In a recent SCOTUS hearing on a redistricting case in Louisiana, the Court’s conservative members hinted that they are leaning in that direction. If it happens, it could shift a dozen or more seats to the GOP, which would put even greater pressure on Democrats in blue states to respond. If Democrats embrace partisan gerrymandering in 2028, it could have significant implications two years later, as congressional districts will be redrawn again in 2030, in concert with the constitutionally mandated census. Ironically, the GOP’s redistricting ploy could push Democrats to go nuclear on partisan redistricting in 2030, potentially cancelling out most of the partisan gains Republicans stand to make from redrawing maps in Texas, Missouri and elsewhere. So all these special legislative sessions, state constitution amendments and costly referendums could change little. But make no mistake: They will have an impact. A redistricting race to the bottom will create more and more one-party states, with little to no federal representation from a rival political party. The country’s already substantial political divides will grow wider and deeper. The standard criticism of gerrymandering is that it allows politicians to choose their voters. The current redistricting craze could have an even more enduring impact — by allowing both political parties to choose what kind of country they want: a red one or a blue one. Michael A.

A transgender high school student in Indiana accused of plotting a Valentine’s Day mass shooting has reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit murder. Trinity J. Shockley, 18, was charged in February in Morgan Superior Court with conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of intimidation to commit terrorism. Shockley identifies as a transgender male and often goes by Jamie or Dex, according to authorities. Court records show a plea agreement was filed Friday, with a hearing held Monday where Shockley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, a Level 2 felony. The two intimidation charges were dropped under the deal.

Under Indiana law, a person convicted of a Level 2 felony faces between 10 and 30 years in prison. The Indianapolis Star reported that Shockley’s attorney requested a sentence of no more than 12.5 years in prison and up to five years of probation.

(Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun Sentinel via AP, Pool) Authorities said Shockley’s alleged plan to attack Mooresville High School was uncovered when the FBI in Indianapolis received a tip and contacted the Mooresville Metropolitan Police Department. The FBI later said it \"swiftly coordinated\" with local officials to investigate. The tip indicated that Shockley planned a shooting, had access to an AR-15 rifle and had ordered a bulletproof vest. It also said Shockley was infatuated with Nikolas Cruz, who carried out the 2018 Parkland school shooting on Valentine’s Day. A search of Shockley’s home by the Morgan County Sheriff’s Department revealed a \"shrine\" to recent mass shooters, including Cruz, Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in a Charleston church, and Ethan Crumbley, who carried out the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Michigan. Court documents said Shockley also kept a photo album and buttons featuring the shooters’ faces.

Rozier was accused of conspiring with associates to help them win bets based on statistical performance in a game he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets in March 2023. Sportsbooks detected an unusual pattern of wagers on the Charlotte game in question, including prop bets involving Rozier. The bets were flagged and immediately brought to the league’s attention. The league initially cleared Rozier of any wrongdoing. \"While the unusual betting on Terry Rozier’s ‘unders’ in the March 2023 game was detected in real time because the bets were placed legally, we believe there is more that can be done from a legal/regulatory perspective to protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues,\" the league said.

Jones was accused of tipping off associates to the injury status of LeBron James and Anthony Davis before a Los Angeles Lakers game. There was no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was accused of doing. \"With sports betting now occupying such a significant part of the current sports landscape, every effort must be made to ensure that players, coaches, and other NBA personnel are fully aware of the dire risks that gambling can impose upon their careers and livelihoods; that our injury disclosure rules are appropriate; and that players are protected from harassment from bettors,\" the league added.

Seven years after the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, a new documentary shines a light on the brave Pittsburgh first responders who faced unimaginable danger inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018.

(Matt Rourke/AP file) \"For five years, the officers were under a gag order from the federal court while they were charging and trying the perpetrator, so some of the emotional trauma for the first responders was never talked about until now,\" documentary maker Jon Becker told Fox News Digital. \"None of these officers will ever be completely the same as they were before this and in every single one of their lives,\" he added. \"They went into that building knowing this guy could kill them to save people that they\u0027ve never even met.\" On Oct. 27, 2018, Bowers stormed the Tree of Life building in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood during Shabbat services, targeting congregants from Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin hopes Republican voters being unable to feed their loved ones at Thanksgiving would bring GOP lawmakers back to the negotiating table to end the government shutdown. The shutdown began 27 days ago when Republicans and Democrats were unable to come to an agreement on a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government. The disagreement stems from certain healthcare provisions. Democrats warn that Americans\u0027 health insurance premiums will increase if their provision isn\u0027t included in the CR, while the GOP argues the provision would provide healthcare to illegal immigrants. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it does not have the ability to independently reshuffle funds into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, according to a recent memo obtained by Fox News Digital. If this continues, 42 million Americans could lose access to food stamps if the shutdown continues. Hostin put the blame on Republicans for the shutdown on Monday. \u0027THE VIEW\u0027 CO-HOSTS BICKER OVER DEMOCRATS\u0027 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN STRATEGY Sunny Hostin speculated on whether Republicans will \"come back to the table\" when their families begin to suffer in red states.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., joins \u0027The Faulkner Focus\u0027 to share her reaction to House Minority Whip Katherine Clark calling the government shutdown a tool in negotiations with Republicans. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! FIRST ON FOX: Small business owners are losing billions in funding due to the government shutdown, with industry leaders publishing a letter Monday demanding lawmakers pass a \"clean CR\" and reopen the federal government. \"On behalf of our organizations representing millions of entrepreneurs and small business owners, we are calling on U.S. Senators to put an end to the instability and hardship by passing a clean continuing resolution, which will allow negotiations to continue on spending measures moving through Congress, including the future of the COVID credits that will expire at year-end,\" a letter addressed to U.S. senators across the board and first obtained by Fox News Digital states. \"The viability of thousands of small businesses is at risk due to the shutdown, and it is unacceptable that the livelihoods of owners and their employees are being sacrificed for spending demands that can be resolved through regular order.\" The letter was signed by six industry groups, including the Family Business Coalition, International Franchise Association, Job Creators Network, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, National Restaurant Association and the Small Business \u0026 Entrepreneurship Council. The government shut down Oct. 1 after Senate lawmakers failed to reach a funding agreement before a midnight deadline. Leaders of both political parties have since cast blame for the shutdown on each other, with Republicans arguing Democrats sought taxpayer-funded medical benefits for illegal immigrants in their legislation, while Democrats have denied the accusation and claimed Republicans won\u0027t join the negotiation table on healthcare for citizens. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 101: WE\u0027VE BEEN HERE BEFORE, HERE\u0027S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT A sign reading \"The U.S. Capitol Visiting Center is closed due to a lapse in appropriations\" is displayed at the entrance of the U.S. Capitol Visiting Center. (Probal Rashid/LightRocket via Getty Images) The letter urged lawmakers to reopen the government while pointing to a handful of examples of how Americans are suffering due to the shutdown, including small business owners losing out on billions in funding. \"According to the (Small Business Administration), 4,800 small businesses have been blocked from receiving $2.5 billion in capital since the start of the shutdown,\" the groups warned. \"Every day the shutdown continues means another 320 small businesses will not have access to the SBA-backed commercial loans these businesses were counting on for expansion and growth. Hundreds of thousands of workers are impacted by the suspension through furloughs, reduced jobs and wages, along with missed opportunities for local economies.\" The Small Business Administration released data earlier in October showing 320 small business owners have lost $170 million in funding each day due to the shutdown, which has resulted in at least $2.5 billion in funding that cannot be delivered to business owners. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital that the \"Democrat shutdown\" has caused \"chaos\" that is gripping business owners no matter the size of the company. SHUTDOWN IGNITES STRATEGIST DEBATE: WILL TRUMP AND GOP PAY THE POLITICAL PRICE IN 2026? The White House slammed Democrats for the ongoing shutdown that will cause the National Nuclear Security Administration to furlough 80% of its staff.

Millions of small businesses and entrepreneurs have made it very clear — it is time for Senate Democrats to pass the clean continuing resolution, reopen the government, and stop using Americans as ‘leverage’ for their radical policies,\" Rogers said. The letter added that disruptions to air travel and air traffic controller shortages have affected business owners and consumers, alike, and that small business owners are feeling the pinch of \"ever-increasing costs and diminishing choices\" as they relate to healthcare coverage. SOCIAL SECURITY, AIRPORTS, FOOD STAMPS: HOW ARE YOU AFFECTED DURING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? A coalition of six business groups urged Senate lawmakers to reopen the government while pointing to a handful of examples of how Americans are suffering due to the shutdown, including small business owners losing out on billions in funding. (Liao Pan/China News Service via Getty Images) \"With respect to the rising cost of health insurance premiums, small businesses have been the hardest hit by years of ever-increasing costs and diminishing choices. Premium tax credit expiration represents only a fraction of the reason why many small businesses are seeing hefty premium increases for next year. Lowering costs and increasing affordable choices will be resolved through comprehensive reforms that need to be addressed by Congress and state legislatures. Congress must commit to this important task as well,\" the letter stated. \"The effects of the shutdown will only grow wider with each passing day unless the Senate acts. Passing a clean CR is a smart, responsible, and bipartisan course of action. It will provide certainty for small business owners, employees and workers who are counting on actions from their elected officials that produce certainty and stability. We urge every Senator to support a clean CR that allows the appropriations process to move forward to ensure the federal government remains open and operational,\" the letter said. The shutdown currently does not have an end in sight. Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are taking issue with Trump traveling to Asia this week to meet with foreign leaders. \"Americans deserve a government that works as hard as they do — not a leader that flies away from responsibility at the time they need one most,\" Schumer said Friday.

Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla\u0027s latest FSD update Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year\u0027s major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode. According to Tesla\u0027s release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla\u0027s advanced driver-assist systems. TESLA\u0027S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla) History of Tesla\u0027s Mad Max mode since 2018 The Mad Max setting isn\u0027t new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone. Now, the feature is back in Tesla\u0027s latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before. Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company\u0027s continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision. Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car\u0027s settings under Speed Profiles. (Chesnot/Getty Images) For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles. What this means for you If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car\u0027s settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation. However, remember that Tesla\u0027s Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority. Tesla’s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) If you share the road with Teslas, it\u0027s smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road. Take my quiz: How safe is your online security? Think your devices and data are truly protected?

It revives a feature from its early Autopilot days while reigniting debate over the balance between innovation and responsibility. The mode\u0027s return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it. Will Tesla\u0027s revived Mad Max mode mark a bold step toward autonomy or a dangerous gamble in the race for self-driving dominance?

Hull joined the Fever in 2022 after a standout collegiate career at Stanford. She was selected No. 6 overall in the 2022 draft.

She received Sixth Woman of the Year votes in 2024 and then averaged a career-high 7.2 points per game in 2025. She started 30 of the 44 games she appeared in under head coach Stephanie White. Hull has been a part of the Clark experience and the increased support and spotlight the Fever have received since the WNBA star entered the league.

Clark and Sophie Cunningham were a part of heated moments against the Connecticut Sun. Hull told Glamour she felt like the team members have a bit of a target on their backs. \"I think there is a level of jealousy when it comes to the Fever, just because of the media attention and the fans that have shown up for us ever since Caitlin got here,\" she said. \"We’ve heard people and players and teams talking in their locker room about, ‘We can’t let the Fever win.’\" Hull suggested those assertions weren’t necessarily a bad thing.

Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., was heckled by Zohran Mamdani\u0027s supporters, who drowned her with chants of \"Tax the rich!\" NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! NEW YORK CITY – New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani defended Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., on Monday after his supporters drowned her out at the podium with chants of \"Tax the rich!\" at her during Sunday night\u0027s high-profile rally in Forest Hills, Queens. Mamdani\u0027s plan to raise taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers to pay for his ambitious campaign promises, like free childcare, fast and free buses and city-run grocery stores, would require state approval, but the governor has ruled out raising taxes on New Yorkers. \"Whenever I speak with the governor, it always comes back to affordability, and we have both made clear that that is the defining purpose of our politics, and that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to deliver,\" Mamdani told reporters in Manhattan on Monday. But Mamdani\u0027s supporters, knowing Hochul has been unwilling to budge on raising taxes, disrupted her remarks on Sunday, shouting, \"Tax the rich!\" The chants forced Mamdani to walk out on stage early and taking her hand in his to affirm his support for the governor. MAMDANI SPARKS ONLINE FRENZY OVER RESPONSE TO WHETHER HE ENDORSES NY GOV HOCHUL: \u0027HUMILIATING\u0027 New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and Gov. Kathy Hochul hold hands on stage as they attend a \"New York is Not For Sale\" rally at Forest Hills Stadium, in the Queens borough of New York City, on Oct. 26, 2025. (Reuters/Eduardo Munoz) \"I can hear you,\" Hochul responded as the stadium erupted with the chant. Yet Hochul told reporters on Monday that she knows there is \"passion\" to raise taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers, but the governor said she attended Mamdani\u0027s rally, as leader of New York\u0027s Democratic Party, to reaffirm her support for the Democratic mayoral nominee. MAMDANI’S SOCIALIST, CITY-RUN GROCERY PLAN FACES BACKLASH FROM HOCHUL: \u0027I FAVOR FREE ENTERPRISE\u0027 \"What I saw in that stadium was refreshing and energizing to know we can harness all that, to be on the same team and to make sure we can do a lot of great things for the people of this state and indeed the country,\" Hochul said. Mamdani was joined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Sunday for the \"New York is Not for Sale Rally,\" with more than 10,000 people packed into Forest Hills Stadium, according to the campaign. When pressed by a reporter if she would be willing to change her mind about raising taxes, Hochul said, \"I\u0027m having a lot of conversations about everything.\" \"They want to know my timeline. I said let\u0027s get through this election. Let\u0027s let the focus be on your race,\" Hochul added, explaining that she wanted to attend Sunday\u0027s rally as the leader of a diverse Democratic Party. She also said she wasn\u0027t sure what the hecklers were saying. \"I couldn\u0027t hear what they were chanting. I thought they were saying, \u0027Let\u0027s go, Bills.\u0027 I wasn\u0027t sure,\" Hochul said.

I appreciate her support for universal childcare, which is something that\u0027s been a longstanding priority for her.\" \"I went out to hold her hand and hold our hands together to show New York City that the relationship between a mayor and a governor need not always be what it was with Andrew Cuomo. It could, in fact, be one that\u0027s committed to the same set of constituents,\" Mamdani added. With nearly one week until Election Day, Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with 44% of support among likely voters in the most recent survey in the race, from Suffolk University. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who is running as an independent candidate in the general election after losing the primary to Mamdani, has 34% support in the latest survey.

(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz) Hochul endorsed Mamdani last month after previously withholding for months after Mamdani secured the Democratic nomination. While Hochul has now thrown her political weight behind Mamdani as he campaigns to become the next mayor of the nation\u0027s most populous city, Mamdani has refused to endorse her own re-election campaign.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is considering a gubernatorial challenge against Hochul next year, said in a statement that Sunday\u0027s rally \"could not have been more of a disaster\" for Hochul. \"Hochul truly is the Worst Governor in America and voters across the political spectrum, including even the Socialists she bent the knee to, all know that she is truly the Worst Governor in America. New Yorkers will fire Kathy Hochul next year,\" Stefanik said. Fox News\u0027 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

(Credit: Dylan Wallace) NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Passengers on a flight departing Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) were left waiting on the tarmac after a flight attendant accidentally deployed the aircraft’s emergency slide. According to a Reddit post from a user who identified as being on board, the costly mishap happened just before takeoff. \"The flight attendant accidentally triggered the emergency slide,\" the person wrote. \"Everyone’s entire night just became a cluster f---.\" SMOKE FROM UNKNOWN PASSENGER DEVICE FORCES EMERGENCY LANDING OF AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT TO WASHINGTON-DULLES The user described a confusing scene followed by a long delay. The attendant, visibly shaken, quickly addressed passengers. \"He did apologize and was quite flustered,\" the post continued, adding that the crew member mentioned that in his 26-year career, it had never happened before. Emergency slides are very costly in the airline industry, so mistakenly deploying them can be an expensive error. (iStock) When another Redditor asked whether passengers at least got to use the slide to deplane, the original poster joked: \"Haha. That would be fun. They specifically said that would be a bigger trouble.\" Instead, it took maintenance crews about an hour to unhook and remove the deployed slide. Only then did airport staff bring the jet bridge back so that travelers could exit the plane safely. TWO DELTA REGIONAL JETS COLLIDE ON TAXIWAY AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT; 1 INJURED The original poster said the incident happened while the other flight attendant was announcing that the plane was leaving the gate, and guessed that it happened while the flight attendant was closing the plane doors. \"The jet bridge just left. I guess he meant to secure the door, but instead opened it?\" Flight attendants often communicate with ground control to make sure everything is set for takeoff. (iStock) The conversation later suggested that the affected flight may have been Delta 3248 to Salt Lake City (SLC), which experienced a significant delay that evening. In this case, no passengers were hurt, just stranded for an unexpected hour. As one commenter summed it up, the night may have turned into a \"cluster f---,\" but hopefully, at least, everyone could laugh about it later. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Evacuation slides are intended for use only in emergencies, such as when a rapid evacuation is required, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). During normal operations, flight attendants are required to \"disarm\" the slides before any aircraft door is opened on the ground. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Accidentally deploying one is considered a serious mistake, as each slide can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repack and replace, and often renders the aircraft temporarily inoperable. The procedure for disarming these systems can differ depending on the aircraft model, according to experts. Emergency slides are designed to deploy instantly in the event of an evacuation and are armed manually once the aircraft door is closed. (iStock) On some planes, the cabin crew performs the disarming process from inside, while in other cases, it may involve coordination with ground staff who operate from the exterior. TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that emergency slide deployments cost airlines around $20 million per year.

New York City is at a breaking point. Hardworking New Yorkers are being told to accept more corruption, more chaos or more ideological extremism. But there\u0027s a real alternative: me. Zohran Mamdani is a radical socialist with ideas so reckless that even longtime Democrats are alarmed. In 2021, I warned everyone that Eric Adams, our current mayor, would be corrupt. People didn\u0027t listen. Instead, we got resignations, arrests, indictments and a pay-to-play culture that hollowed out City Hall while basic services fell behind and working New Yorkers paid the price. As for former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, he resigned in disgrace after a barrage of sexual harassment allegations that are now being settled with taxpayer dollars. He helped bring us the crime wave New Yorkers live with now by ushering in bail reform, Raise the Age, Less Is More and the HALT Act. TRADING BARBS FROM LIGHT-HEARTED TO VICIOUS, MAYORAL CANDIDATES MAKE FINAL APPEAL TO NEW YORKERS Cuomo’s rent laws punished small property owners, his energy decisions closed Indian Point and drove up utility costs, and his congestion pricing scheme taxes you just for trying to get to work. Here\u0027s the truth that New Yorkers already sense: Cuomo and Mamdani are two sides of the same coin – different labels, same results: higher costs, weaker safety, and ideology over common sense.

While 10 U.S. Code § 2601 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use the funds, the U.S. Constitution’s appropriations clause in Article I, § 9, cl. 7 states the money has to be deposited into the U.S. Treasury first, and can’t be used on service member salaries until Congress creates a law appropriating the funds.

However, Andrew had refused to budge, citing his lengthy lease. The Prince and Princess of Wales are leaving Adelaide Cottage next month and moving to Forest Lodge. On Oct. 17, Andrew announced he was relinquishing his Duke of York title and other honors after renewed scrutiny over his friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The outlet, which obtained a copy of the leasehold agreement for Royal Lodge, reported Andrew paid £1 million for the lease, plus at least £7.5 million for refurbishments completed in 2005. He has paid \"one peppercorn (if demanded)\" in rent per year since 2003. If Andrew were to give up his lease early, the British newspaper reported that the crown estate would owe him a \"compensatory sum\" of about £185,865 per year — totaling more than £557,595 — until the 25-year agreement is up in 2028. The outlet previously reported that Andrew raised enough money to live in Royal Lodge.

(Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images) In Lehfeldt\u0027s announcement that he would not seek re-election, he cited \"lawsuits\" and \"death threats\" as a reason for his decision. Lehfeldt has been at the center of controversy for USA Fencing dating back to April when women\u0027s fencer Stephanie Turner went viral for kneeling in protest of a transgender fencer, and was disqualified. The incident prompted a federal subpoena of Lehfeldt to a congressional hearing to explain the organization\u0027s policy on transgender athletes. Then, former Olympic coach and board member Andrey Geva and former Olympic fencer Abdel Salem sued Lehfeldt for allegedly making \"false statements\" at the hearing. \"I didn’t sign up to spend my nights and weekends dealing with lawsuits, death threats, and distractions that pull focus from the real work of governing and growing our sport. I want to get back to fencing, to mentoring, to coaching, and to just being part of the community I love, not constantly defending it in courtrooms and comment sections,\" Lehfeldt said in his announcement. \"I knew it would be hard work, but I underestimated just how much of my time and energy it would take. Between my full-time job, young kids, and using nearly all my vacation days to volunteer, I’ve reached a point where I’m simply tired.\" Lehfeldt included a paragraph in his announcement advocating for inclusion in the fencing. \"Fencing is for everyone,\" Lehfeldt said. \"No matter your race, religion, gender, gender identity, or socioeconomic background — this sport belongs to you. That’s not just a slogan to me; it’s a commitment. And even with the challenges we’ve faced, I’m going to keep fighting for a fencing community that’s open, accessible, and welcoming to all.\" Ahead of the May 7 congressional hearing, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes, Lehfeldt made a series of posts on his Instagram Stories that were later blown up and used against him on the committee floor. In one post, which went viral before the hearing, he responded to a question that asked whether he was \"okay\" with putting female fencers at a disadvantage with a simple, brash answer: \"Yeah.\" During the hearing, Lehfeldt admitted multiple times that he regretted answering that way and the question required a \"more-nuanced\" response. At one point during the hearing, Lefheldt confessed to falsifying an email from a fictitious fencing mother, \"Dorothy,\" who disagreed with him, and compared those with similar views to a Ku Klux Klan \"grand wizard.\" \"It was a poor attempt at humor,\" Lehfeldt said.

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Rep. Tim Burhcett, R-Tenn., asked Lehfeldt whether he would let his daughter fence against \"a man.\" Lehfeldt suggested he would allow it while boasting about his organization\u0027s safety precautions. \"As long as the competitor has met all the hormonal requirements and complies with the policy, I would be OK with it,\" Lehfeldt said. Turner previously told Fox News Digital after the May hearing that she would work to lobby leadership changes to USA Fencing after stepping away from the sport. \"I\u0027m going to be pushing for people to resign, to be honest. I\u0027d like to see some people resign for the comments that they\u0027ve made, especially publicly, ones that are harassing and meant to humiliate concerned women, mothers and daughters,\" Turner said. USA Fencing\u0027s board voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events, at its June 7 meeting. The previous policies became one of the organization\u0027s biggest points of criticism after Turner\u0027s viral protest. USA Fencing then changed its transgender participation policy in July to only permit female competitors to participate in the women\u0027s category. The change was made to ensure compliance with the USOPC\u0027s new athlete safety policy, which now cites President Donald Trump\u0027s \"Keeping Men Out of Women\u0027s Sports\" executive order.

Washington is barreling into its fifth week of a government shutdown, and despite a handful of payday deadlines for federal workers fast-approaching, there’s been little progress made toward turning the lights back on. The Senate is expected to again vote on a House-passed plan to reopen the government this week but has failed to advance the continuing resolution (CR) 12 times. As before, the legislation — which would reopen the government until Nov. 21 — is expected to fail again. The same dispute that triggered the shutdown nearly a month ago remains unresolved. DEMOCRATS EYE KEY OBAMACARE DEADLINE AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENTERS 4TH WEEK Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have continued to dig in against Senate Republicans in their bid to reopen the government. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., want an ironclad deal to extend expiring Obamacare premium subsidies, while Senate Republicans want to address the issue only after the government is reopened. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., argued that Democrats’ position had little to do with the actual premium tax credits, nor a desire for negotiations. \"It\u0027s politics,\" he said. \"Well, they’d like you to believe that it\u0027s about healthcare,\" he said on the Senate floor last week. \"It\u0027s not. Republicans have been perfectly clear that we\u0027re willing to have a discussion about healthcare, just not while government funding is being held hostage and all the federal employees that come with that. So if this were really about healthcare, Democrats would be voting in favor of the clean CR as the quickest way to reopen the government.\" In the meantime, payday deadlines for air traffic controllers, military service members, and a funding cliff for federal nutrition assistance programs are right around the corner. Air traffic controllers are expected to miss their first full paycheck on Tuesday after being partially paid earlier this month.

(Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images) Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Chair Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has a bill that would fill that funding gap that is expected to be put on the floor for a vote this week. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has not yet teed it up. Then there is the military payday coming on Oct. 31. President Donald Trump previously moved around billions in funding to cover troops’ paychecks earlier this month, but that money is not expected to cover this upcoming pay cycle. Sen. Ron Johnson’s, R-Wis., bill to pay troops and \"excepted\" federal workers — meaning federal workers who are currently working during the shutdown but not being paid — was blocked by Senate Democrats last week. However, there is an effort between Johnson and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to bring a new version of the bill to the floor. Van Hollen also tried to get his own bill to pay federal workers and troops on the floor last week but was blocked in the process. Van Hollen, like other Senate Democrats, warned that Johnson’s version of the bill would allow Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought a \"blank check as to who they’re going to send home and who they’re going to punish by not paying.\" SCHUMER BLOCKS 12TH GOP BID TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT AS TRUMP SAYS DEMOCRATS \u0027LOST THE NEGOTIATION\u0027 Washington is barreling into its fifth week of a government shutdown, and despite a handful of payday deadlines for federal workers fast-approaching, there’s been little progress made toward turning the lights back on. (Getty Images) \"Not one of our federal employees, service members, or contractors deserves to be punished for this government shutdown,\" Van Hollen said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"I’m continuing to work to make sure they’re not.\" And on Nov. 1, the same day as the beginning of open enrollment for Obamacare, funding for food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is expected to run out. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats received another blow to their unified front as the shutdown drags on from an outside ally that donates millions of dollars to Democratic political action committees and candidates. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal employees in the nation that represents over 800,000 workers, demanded that Democrats swallow the Republicans’ clean CR to reopen the government. Everett Kelley, president of the massive union, said in an open letter on Monday that the best path forward was to, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues,\" and ensure that every federal employee that has been working or furloughed under the shutdown receive back pay. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren’t looking for partisan spin,\" Kelley said. \"They’re looking for the wages they earned.

Hazameh added that the coach offered to explain why after the game, but the player didn\u0027t take her up on the offer. McPherson said, \"I had texted her myself too, around 4:30, and I asked her if I could sit on the bench because she told Hadeel I had to ask for myself.

But the circumstances took a toll on them over the last two months. Hazameh said she recently broke down in tears when she went back to read some old text messages that were exchanged at the end of summer with a friend who graduated last year. \"\u0027I pray that my senior year is as amazing as your guys\u0027 year, and I just hope that I have an amazing year,\u0027\" the text message read. \"I just broke down in tears because my senior year has absolutely been horrible, and everything that I was excited for and looking forward to just crumbled.\" Hazameh and McPherson recounted stories of getting hurtful messages on social media, and getting \"dirty looks\" in the hallways.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! It\u0027s called a sports equinox, and it\u0027s happening once in 2025, on Monday, October 27. It\u0027s a rare day when all four major U.S. Sports leagues: the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League, all have games scheduled. \"That day, you have ten NBA games. You have two NHL games. You have a Monday Night Football game, and then you\u0027re gonna have game three of the World Series,\" says Bookies.com Senior Betting Analyst Bill Speros. Adding to the excitement is the possibility of seeing some of the top athletes from each league play at the same time. \"There\u0027ll be a period of time come Monday night, that within the span of an hour, you\u0027ll get to see Shohei Ohtani, Patrick Mahomes, Sidney Crosby, and Steph Curry all play,\" says Speros. And analysts say this action can be fun for those looking to place bets. \"You can do cross-sport prop wagers. So, you could do a wager perhaps on Shohei Ohtani, how many hits he may get.... With Patrick Mahomes, you might want to do his over-under on yards or completions. With Crosby, it might be will he get a goal or an assist? And with Steph Curry, maybe it\u0027s over/under his point total or his assist total,\" says Speros. Meanwhile, the interest in legal sports betting is also helping to increase ratings for many games. \"Every week, they\u0027re breaking records. And those numbers are driven in huge part by gambling,\" says Speros. And when it comes to responsibly placing wagers, experts advise going through a legally licensed sportsbook or online betting site.

HOW TO SPOT AND STOP AI PHISHING SCAMS How the phishing email scam works Phishing emails copy trusted companies to create panic and urgency. The goal is simple: get you to click. In this case, the email claimed my American Express account was \"temporarily restricted\" until I verified my identity. A fake American Express email tried to steal personal data using urgent, fear-based language. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) A closer look revealed several red flags: The sender\u0027s email was not from an official American Express domain. The \"Click Here\" button linked to a strange website. The message used fear-based language about account suspension. Each of these clues points to a fake email designed to steal login details or credit card numbers. SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS Learn to spot red flags like strange email addresses and fake \"verify account\" requests. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) What to do if you receive a phishing email If an email looks suspicious: Do not click any links. Check the sender\u0027s address. Real companies use verified domains, not random ones. Go directly to the company website by typing the URL into your browser. Report the email. American Express asks customers to forward phishing messages to spoof@americanexpress.com. Delete the email right away. These steps can protect you from identity theft and financial fraud. PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS Strong passwords, 2FA and data removal services help defend against digital scams. (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images) 10 tips to protect yourself from phishing emails Phishing scams that mimic real companies like American Express can slip into your inbox looking almost legitimate. The best way to stay safe is to create strong digital habits that protect your information and your peace of mind. Here are the top ways to defend yourself against phishing threats and financial fraud. 1) Turn on two-factor authentication for financial accounts Adding two-factor authentication (2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger. 2) Consider using a data removal service Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u0027t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u0027s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com. Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com. 3) Keep your browser and security software updated Outdated browsers and antivirus programs leave gaps that scammers can exploit. Regular updates close those gaps and strengthen your defense against phishing links and malicious downloads. Set your software to update automatically so you are always protected when opening emails or clicking links. 4) Review account statements and transactions regularly Make it a habit to log into your credit card accounts directly from the official website, not from email links. Scan your statements for unfamiliar transactions. Early detection helps you report fraud fast and recover funds before more damage is done. 5) Pause and verify before you click anything Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks. 6) Use strong antivirus software Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com. 7) Use an identity monitoring service Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com. 8) Learn to recognize official communications Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company\u0027s official fraud department and delete it immediately. 9) Back up your important data securely If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information. 10) Trust your instincts If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe. Kurt\u0027s key takeaways Phishing scams are becoming more advanced, but your awareness is your best defense. When you know how to spot fake emails and stay calm under pressure, you protect both your money and your peace of mind. So next time you get an \"urgent\" message about your account, ask yourself: Would your bank really contact you this way? Have you ever received a suspicious email like this?

His lawyer, Teny Geragos, filed a letter on Oct. 6, asking that Judge Arun Subramanian ask the Bureau of Prisons to suggest Fort Dix for her client. In the letter, obtained by Fox News Digital, Geragos said that Combs would be able to \"address drug abuse issues\" and \"maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts\" in the prison\u0027s RDAP program.

Other instances of the alleged \"inhumane\" conditions the rapper has been subjected to include limited access to clean water, food with maggots in it, no physical therapy, lack of physical exercise and no functioning washing machine or dryer.

Trump is poised to brief them once he returns from his trip to Asia that wraps up Thursday, Graham told \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\" \"President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia,\" Graham said. \"So, there will be a congressional briefing about a potential expanding from the sea to the land.

FIRST ON FOX: The Biden administration’s FBI used a security-clearance process to potentially retaliate against a whistleblower, and even tried to interrogate his wife while denying her repeated requests for an attorney, according to the House Judiciary Committee. In a letter signed by Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Jen Kiggans, R-Va., the committee on Monday informed FBI Director Kash Patel that the Biden administration used a security-clearance interview process to skirt whistleblower protections and investigate Special Agent Valentine Fertitta in 2024. \u0027MOST TRANSPARENT\u0027 FBI EVER: PATEL UPDATES SENATE ON KIRK ASSASSINATION PROBE Rep.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Fertitta had blown the whistle on the FBI’s misuse of \"law-enforcement authorities.\" After that, his security clearance evaluation process became unusually prolonged. During that time, the FBI made attempts to interrogate his wife, Emily Fertitta, and asked her to participate in a two-day interview. When Mrs. Fertitta pushed back and asked to have an attorney present, the Department of Justice effectively denied her request. \"Documents available to the Committee show that SecD investigators denied Mrs. Fertitta the right to receive advice from an attorney during her interview and the opportunity to review FBI guidelines regarding the interview process beforehand,\" the letter states.

Essentially, he/she will just sit there silently.’\" The demand to interview Mrs. Fertitta goes against the standard process for security clearance evaluations. The agency’s SEAD 4 Guidelines, the procedures that govern the standards, do not allow the agency to deny spousal privilege — a spouse’s legal right to refuse to testify against their partner in criminal cases.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspected assassin accused of shooting Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a campus appearance at Utah Valley University last month, will no longer show his face in a Provo courthouse at a planned in-person hearing later this week. Robinson returned to court Monday for a virtual appearance where he spoke only briefly, off-camera, as the judge ruled on a motion to allow him to wear normal clothes in court going forward. Judge Tony Graf granted Robinson\u0027s motion to appear in street clothes going forward but denied his motion to appear without restraints. He did not make a decision on a motion from the prosecution to have all non-evidentiary hearings held remotely going forward, and he told the sides they could submit a new motion seeking to have news cameras limited in the courtroom. He also explained that the now-canceled Oct. 30 hearing was pushed back because lawyers needed more time for discovery and to brief their motions. WHAT WILL BE TYLER ROBINSON’S DEFENSE STRATEGY?

The 22-year-old is accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and has attended his two latest public hearings remotely and without showing his face. (Utah 4th Judicial District Court) Robinson\u0027s lawyers will have to provide jail officials with street clothing 72 hours prior to any upcoming hearings, the judge said. \"The court finds that Mr. Robinson\u0027s right to the presumption of innocence outweighs the minimal inconvenience of permitting civilian attire,\" Graf said during the 20-minute hearing. However, he said, due to safety concerns and the seriousness of the charges against him, the defendant should still wear minimal restraints in court. Robinson spoke only briefly during the appearance, in which he appeared remotely from jail and did not show his face. This split image shows suspected assassin Tyler James Robinson, left, and victim Charlie Kirk, a founder of Turning Point USA, on the right. (Gov. Spencer Cox\u0027s office; AP Photo/Alex Brandon) When the judge asked if he could hear the proceedings, Robinson replied, \"Yes, I can.\" In Utah, preliminary hearings can be delayed for months in cases involving serious felonies, sometimes up to a year, Skye Lazaro, a Salt Lake City-based defense attorney, told Fox News Digital earlier this month. The hearing gives the defense a chance to cross-examine witnesses and force prosecutors to show evidence in court that establishes probable cause to bring charges in the alleged crime.

Together, we’ve made it through triumph and tragedy, boom and bust, from the AIDS crisis to 9/11, from Hurricane Sandy to COVID-19. I know her people, her spirit, and her potential better than anyone. And I know this much: the New York we love—the city of safety, opportunity, and promise—is on the line. Early voting is underway. I’m running for mayor of the greatest city on Earth, and I’m asking you to join me to keep it that way. Let’s be honest. I haven’t always been perfect. I’ve made mistakes and I’ve taken my hits. But for decades, my record has been one of results — real, measurable progress for real people. I worked across the aisle, cut taxes for working families and held the line on state spending, proving that fiscal responsibility and progressive values can coexist. MAJOR NEW YORK PAPER ENDORSES ANDREW CUOMO OVER \u0027CALLOW AND MEALY-MOUTHED\u0027 MAMDANI I built what others said couldn’t be built: the new LaGuardia Airport, the Kosciuszko Bridge, the Second Avenue Subway, and Moynihan Train Hall. I led the effort to bring Amazon jobs to New York before political grandstanding chased them away. And when crisis struck, I led with steadiness and science, not slogans. That’s the leadership New York needs again. This election isn’t about left versus right. It’s about common sense versus chaos, competence versus ideology. It’s about whether we restore a city that works, or surrender it to extremism and decline. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, left, and Independent candidate former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, right, pose during the second half of an NBA basketball game between the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, at Madison Square Garden in New York. (Frank Franklin II/AP) Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani represents a dangerous new strain of politics, one that mistakes protest for progress and theatrics for leadership. His vision is not a plan for New York’s future; it’s an existential threat to it. He’s called to defund the police, decriminalize prostitution, and close Rikers Island without any real plan for the 7,000 people it houses. He thinks capitalism is the problem, attacks our law enforcement officers, and mocks the very institutions that keep this city safe and functioning. CUOMO WARNS THERE WILL BE \u0027NOBODY LEFT\u0027 IN NEW YORK CITY IF MAMDANI BECOMES MAYOR We’ve seen what happens when City Hall drifts into fantasy and ideology. It happened under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who turned a city that was once the envy of the world into one drowning in crime, homelessness, and dysfunction. Mamdani would be de Blasio on steroids — more reckless, more radical, and more disconnected from the everyday realities of working New Yorkers. Former Gov.

(Hiroko Masuike/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) He is 34 years old, has never managed a budget, run a business, overseen a workforce, or had a real job. His policies read like bumper stickers from a college protest. And if we hand him the keys to City Hall, New Yorkers will pay the price — in jobs, in safety, and in the very character of our neighborhoods. By contrast, my campaign is built on a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and independents united by a simple belief: New York can work again. We can make this the safest, fairest, most affordable big city in America.

(Photo by HIROKO MASUIKE/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) I’ll double the number of specialized high schools, expand Gifted \u0026 Talented programs so excellence isn’t limited by ZIP code, and increase the number of charter schools that have proven to produce for our most vulnerable students. We’ll empower parents, reward great teachers, and make sure every child – whether in a public, charter, or parochial school – has access to opportunity and accountability. SPARKS FLY AS CUOMO, MAMDANI TEAR INTO EACH OTHER DURING FIERY DEBATE: \u0027TOXIC ENERGY\u0027 I’ll cut the red tape that drives businesses and families out of New York City. We’ll accelerate the construction of affordable housing by clearing the Department of Housing Preservation and Development’s backlog and increasing the city’s capital subsidy pool, so working families can actually afford to stay. I’ll eliminate taxes on tips and overtime and cap property taxes for homeowners. And we’ll make New York competitive again for employers large and small — because a job is the greatest social program ever invented. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Curtis Sliwa is a fighter, and I respect that. But let’s be candid: This is a two-person race. Curtis cannot win. Every vote for Sliwa is a vote for Mamdani. And a vote for Mamdani is a vote for policies that would dismantle the progress we’ve made and jeopardize the city’s future.

College and education news outlet Campus Reform obtained syllabi from two previous semesters of the undergraduate course, titled \"Legal Studies 132AC: Immigration and Citizenship,\" revealing that the class explored American immigration law through the lens of far-left movements, including anti-ICE, racial justice and LGBTQ activism. \"We often hear that America is a ‘nation of immigrants.’ But this representation of the United States does not explain why some are presumed to belong in the United States, and others are not,\" the spring 2024 syllabus stated. COURT APPROVES SETTLEMENT AFTER NORTH CAROLINA STUDENT SUSPENDED FOR \u0027ILLEGAL ALIENS\u0027 COMMENT According to syllabi obtained by Campus Reform, UC Berkeley has been offering courses on immigration law that align with the Abolish ICE movement. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty) It continued: \"Why are non-White Latinos and Asian Americans so often considered ‘alien citizens,’ as American citizens who are nonetheless presumed to be foreign? And why are those of European descent assumed to belong, regardless of their citizenship?\" The course can be found on UC Berkeley’s website, which displays a similar description to the one on the syllabus. It was taught in 2024 by Professor Christina Lee, who also serves as managing attorney at Immigrant Legal Defense, a nonprofit offering legal support to immigrant communities. Lee was joined in spring 2025 by Professor Lisa Knox, an attorney and co-executive director of the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice — another nonprofit that provides legal support to detained immigrants. The group’s website features anti–ICE imagery. JIMMY KIMMEL\u0027S LATE-NIGHT EVOLUTION FROM APOLITICAL FUNNYMAN TO DEM ACTIVIST Anti-ICE protesters march in Chicago. (Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images) Under the \"Learning Objectives\" section of the document, it stated that students will \"Gain an understanding of the basic legal framework of American immigration law.\" It added that students will also gain \"an understanding of the ways in which ideas about race, gender, and sexuality have shaped U.S. immigration law and policies, through historical accounts of the specific experiences of Asian-American, European American, Latinx, Native/Indigenous, and Black/Afro-descendant people in the U.S.\" The spring 2025 course schedule included several examples of far-left–leaning material. Class Two, titled, \"Critical Race Theory and Polyculturalism,\" was set to delve into the questions, \"What is critical race theory? How is it relevant to the study of immigration law? What is polyculturalism, and how does it differ from multiculturalism? How is it relevant to the study of immigration law?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE A large group of illegal immigrants is seen from above in Texas near the Mexican border. (Texas Department of Public Safety) Another lecture, titled \"Origins of Federal Immigration Law,\" asked, \"How did ideas of race and ideas of racial superiority shape the emergence of federal immigration law? How does the legal classification of former slaves and Native Americans as ‘immigrants’ tell us about the early conception of citizenship in the U.S.?\" Class Ten analyzed immigration law through an LGBTQ lens. The syllabus asked: \"How does federal immigration law define ‘family’? What types of families are protected and privileged under existing immigration laws? How does this framework impact LGBTQ and family structures that differ from dominant social norms?\" Class Sixteen focused on the \"Abolish ICE\" movement, asking, \"What does Immigration and Customs Enforcement do? Why was it created, and how was its creation influenced by the post-9/11 political climate? What is the Abolish ICE movement, and what are its goals?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A spokesperson for UC Berkeley did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., blasted Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on Monday for calling U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean \"sanctioned murder.\" \"To say that we\u0027re engaging in murder is just such an outrage,\" Graham said on \"Fox \u0026 Friends.\" \"The president of the United States as commander in chief has the authority to do these strikes. Nobody accused Bush of committing murder when he invaded Panama to take down Noriega. \"Nobody accused Reagan of murder when he went into Grenada to stop Cuban influence growing in Grenada, threatening our backyard, so the president has history on his side, he has the Constitution on his side,\" he added.

If there’s an act of war, then you use our military, and then you come and talk to us first. But… this is sanctioned murder,\" Gallego said. The Trump administration has carried out 10 strikes targeting suspected drug trafficking boats that allegedly contained narco-terrorists, including Tren de Aragua gang members, since the president returned to office in January. Some, including Republicans, have questioned the legality of such actions. Graham zeroed in on his Democratic colleagues, however, sending a message that consulting Congress isn\u0027t always necessary.

With Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers facing his former Green Bay Packers squad as both teams looked for their fifth win of the season, it was bound to get chippy at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday night. A massive scrum on the field in the second half led to multiple referees taking hits trying to break things up. The Packers owned a 22-19 lead in the fourth quarter when Steelers linebacker Nick Niemann was flagged for instigating an altercation. While the penalty flag hit the turf, a big scuffle ensued with players on both teams getting involved.

(Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images) Multiple players got into it and referees were trying to calm the situation down when two of them were knocked to the ground as the scuffle kept moving. It all began when Pittsburgh’s Ben Skowronek was double-teamed by two Packers players during the kickoff. Nick Herbig came over to defend Skowronek and pushed Bo Melton to the ground. PACKERS\u0027 TUCKER KRAFT, JORDAN LOVE TORCH STEELERS, SPOIL AARON RODGERS\u0027 HOPES TO MAKE HISTORY Play stopped for a bit as referees sorted out the brawl, and it was Steelers linebacker Nick Herbig who was ultimately assessed an unnecessary roughness penalty, resulting in a 15-yard gain for the Packers. From that moment, though, the tension continued for both teams until the final whistle saw the Packers come out victorious, 35-25, in a game where Rodgers was trying to become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 teams in his career. It was the first time since he was traded to the New York Jets that Rodgers had faced the Packers, the team he won a Super Bowl with and his four MVP awards. But his former apprentice Jordan Love was the better quarterback in this one, as he threw for three touchdowns and 360 yards on the road Sunday night.

(IMAGN) Two of those touchdowns went to tight end Tucker Kraft, who hauled in a team-leading seven catches for 143 yards in the primetime bout. There were times, though, when Rodgers looked great for the Steelers, including touchdown passes to DK Metcalf and Roman Wilson. But multiple drives stalled for Pittsburgh, leading to Chris Boswell’s multiple field goal attempts, which kept the Steelers in the game. The Packers brought pressure to Rodgers throughout the night, too, as Micah Parsons and Rashan Gary couldn’t stop getting into the backfield.

Next week’s governor races may tell us more about where the shutdown fight is headed than the shutdown itself will show about those elections. While the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia will look largely untouched by the lapse in government funding, their results could serve as a barometer for public perception over who’s at fault for the standoff dragging out in Washington, D.C. But only if the results stand out. Bill Wichterman, former special assistant to President George W. Bush, said the two parties seem entrenched in their positions with no signs of blinking anytime soon. Having seen past shutdown conflicts up close as a policy advisor to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and a chief of staff for other offices, he believes the election results would have to look dramatic to change the resolve of lawmakers.

But if it’s like a normal 5-point win, whatever the norm is, I don’t think Republicans will look at that as alarming.\" Both Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, lead their Republican challengers with just a week to go until Election Day.

CIATTARELLI HITS SHERRILL FOR VOTING TO AVERT SHUTDOWNS UNDER BIDEN BUT NOT TRUMP In the aftermath of a presidential election, Wichterman said a good performance by the minority party isn\u0027t particularly surprising; that would fit the historical trend for how the public reacts to a new president of either party. \"A Democratic win in those two states? Does that freak out Republicans? No, they’re both blue states,\" Wichterman said. But if Republican gubernatorial candidates can pull upsets, Wichterman believes that changes things. \"I think Democrats would look at that and say, ‘My gosh, we’re not doing well. What’s going on here?\u0027 That would be disruptive.\" Republican Jack Ciattarelli, left, looks on while Democrat Mikie Sherrill speaks during the final debate in the New Jersey governor\u0027s race, Oct. 8, 2025, in New Brunswick, N.J. (Heather Khalifa/AP) Government funding ran dry on Oct. 1 when lawmakers failed to reach an agreement over a Republican-led short-term spending bill that would have kept the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have opposed the measure on 12 separate occasions, demanding Congress first consider the extension of COVID-era emergency subsidies for Obamacare premiums. Republicans have rejected those demands out of hand, maintaining that the subsidies have nothing to do with the question of government funding. SHUTDOWN IGNITES STRATEGIST DEBATE: WILL TRUMP AND GOP PAY THE POLITICAL PRICE IN 2026? Despite the lapse in funding, state-level elections will remain largely unaffected. On a practical level, the federal government largely leaves states to carry out their own elections and plays a minimal role in their administration. In many cases, the federal government awards funding for states to update, modernize or shore up security for elections. In one of the most notable examples, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) doesn’t directly help organize state-level elections. Instead, it helps provide funding for security and infrastructure-related expenses through grants established by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). New Jersey and Virginia have each already received $272,700 through HAVA grants in 2025. Congress approved that funding in appropriation legislation earlier this year. Wichterman believes that another way that the election could tip the scales for the shutdown is how the White House reacts. Even if lawmakers in Congress stay put after the election, President Donald Trump’s direction over government funding could force a change in position for lawmakers. So far, Trump hasn’t budged and has his focus elsewhere. On Monday, Trump traveled to Japan to meet with the country\u0027s emperor, among other officials. TRUMP\u0027S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, Oct. 27, 2025. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP) \"I think Democrats have been waiting for Trump to crack [on the shutdown],\" Wichterman said. \"And he’s not. I’ve been in lots of shutdown fights starting back in ‘95. I know what it feels like when you’re part of a party that’s taking on water. Doesn’t feel that way on the Republican side yet.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats expressed similar thoughts as they shot down a supplemental funding bill to pay essential government workers. To them, the gridlock on Capitol Hill likely will remain until something provokes Trump to get personally involved in negotiations. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., believes the president is the only Republican voice that matters. \"He says, ‘Jump,’ they say, ‘How high?’ And so, he’s the one that needs to come to the table,\" Van Hollen said when asked about shutdown-ending negotiations.

It was just last week when Penn State fired head coach James Franklin after a third straight loss, leading to a $49 million buyout by the Nittany Lions to let him get out of his contract. At the time, it seemed wild that a university would be willing to shell out that much money, but the potential buyout for former LSU head coach Brian Kelly could rival Franklin\u0027s. After the Tigers made the decision Sunday night to fire Kelly, less than 24 hours after LSU fell to Texas A\u0026M 49-25 for its third loss in the last four games, both sides are still negotiating the financial terms of the split.

Why Meta created this AI photo feature Many people take photos but then don\u0027t share them because they feel the image isn\u0027t \"post-worthy,\" or they simply don\u0027t have time to make it look good. Meta\u0027s logic: if those moments are sitting unseen in your phone, screenshots, receipts, random snaps, they might still matter to you. So the tool helps you rediscover and share them. From Meta\u0027s perspective, this also fits its bigger push into artificial intelligence-driven features across its apps. LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION New AI tool scans your camera roll to find and polish images for quick sharing. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Behind the scenes, Meta AI analyzes photo details, like lighting, people and events, to group similar moments and create polished collage layouts automatically.

Immediately following the incident, Rutgers imposed a cease and desist order on the fraternity’s activities and placed the chapter on organizational disciplinary probation until May 18 – however, the fraternity has since been shut down in light of the new information obtained by investigators. Additionally, the home belonging to the fraternity\u0027s chapter was broken into last week, NJ.com reported. Authorities believe the burglary took place before the students could return to collect their belongings, occurring between Thursday and Saturday, according to the outlet. While police reportedly did not find any signs of forced entry, several fraternity members noticed crowbar marks and broken glass throughout the home – with some claiming electronics and items of clothing were missing.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! With just over a week until Election Day, Zohran Mamdani holds a double-digit lead in the raucous race for the nation\u0027s most populous city, but former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is narrowing the gap, according to a new public opinion poll. Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from the New York City borough of Queens who shocked the political world in June with his convincing win over Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party\u0027s mayoral nomination, stands at 44% support among likely voters in the most recent survey in the race, from Suffolk University. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who is running as an Independent candidate in the general election after losing the primary, had 34% support in the survey. The survey was conducted Thursday through Sunday, entirely after incumbent Mayor Eric Adams endorsed Cuomo in a bid to defeat Mamdani. The embattled Democratic mayor had been running for re-election as an independent but dropped out of the race late last month, although his name remains on the ballot.

(AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis, Pool) Cuomo has turned up the volume on his criticisms of Mamdani during the closing stretch of the campaign, with dire warnings that \"mayhem\" would follow a Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. He\u0027s also repeatedly spotlighted Mamdani\u0027s Muslim faith and criticized his rival for painting himself as a victim because of his faith. Cuomo has argued that Mamdani has offended Jewish New Yorkers and charged that his rival is antisemitic because of his comments opposing the Israeli government and calling its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza a \"genocide.\" Mamdani, firing back, told reporters recently that \"we’re speaking about a former governor who, in his final moments in public life, is engaging in rhetoric that is not only Islamophobic, not only racist, it’s also disgusting.\" Meanwhile, Sliwa, a longtime fixture in New York City politics, has been the target of a pressure campaign to drop out of the race to set up a one-on-one matchup between Cuomo and Mamdani, in a frantic effort to avert a Mamdani victory. Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa is interviewed by Fox News Digital, in New York City on Aug. 18, 2025 (Paul Steinhauser - Fox News) Among those urging Sliwa to end his bid is billionaire businessman and conservative radio host John Catsimatidis, a top New York City Republican and ally of President Donald Trump. Sliwa voters, when given a second choice, preferred Cuomo over Mamdani by 36%–2%, according to the poll. \"There is only one person in New York City whose voters will determine the outcome,\" Paleologos said. \"And that person isn’t Mayor Adams, Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, or any New York billionaire. It’s Republican Curtis Sliwa and his voters who hold the 11% blocking Cuomo from winning the race.

One of the New York City teens involved in the 2019 stabbing death of 18-year-old Virginian Tessa Majors, a Barnard College freshman, is back behind bars on charges of attempted murder and assault after a slap-on-the-wrist juvenile sentence, according to local reporting. Zyairr Davis, then 13, was one of three teens arrested in the attack, but not the one who delivered the fatal blow. As a result, he received the lightest sentence — 18 months in juvenile detention, while the others saw life sentences. Now he\u0027s back behind bars on charges that include attempted murder in connection with a gang-related shooting into a crowd of people in Harlem, the New York Post reported Sunday. Court records show he faces nearly a dozen new charges in adult court, nearly all of them violent.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! A new report found that Alabama and Kansas lead the nation as the most \"faith-friendly\" while Michigan and Washington rank among the lowest in protecting freedoms for religious nonprofits. Napa Legal Institute\u0027s \"Faith \u0026 Freedom Index,\" now in its third edition, examined 15 factors in state laws that affect faith-based nonprofits and their ability to operate. The report looked at regulatory burdens, including charitable registration laws, as well as religious freedom protections in employment law and state constitutions, to produce scores for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The report’s authors warned that despite the White House\u0027s efforts to protect religious liberty, several states still lag behind in ensuring that faith-based organizations are safeguarded. While many Republican-led states scored high, the report noted results did not fall neatly along partisan lines. Alabama (72%), Kansas (69%), Indiana (68%), Texas (65%) and Mississippi (63%) received the highest overall scores for protecting religious and regulatory freedoms for faith-based nonprofits, according to the 2025 report.

Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Pam Bondi at the Museum of the Bible on Sept. 8, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Alabama and Kansas were cited as having \"stronger protections for religious free exercise or worship\" in their state constitutions than even the First Amendment, according to the report. Both states also earned high marks for having nondiscrimination laws that avoid burdening faith-based employers and for enacting state-level Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs). Yet there were instances where more liberal states outperformed conservative ones in certain legal protections. New York scored slightly better than Alaska, Tennessee and South Carolina in some categories. Connecticut was highlighted for having a state-level RFRA, while Ohio and Alaska lack those laws. The authors emphasized that strong state laws are particularly important in states with leadership that\u0027s less supportive of religious organizations. \"Although California’s current administration is not generally favorable to religion, California nonprofit religious corporations continue to enjoy legal protections such as exemption from state charitable registration requirements and greater autonomy in internal affairs than secular nonprofits,\" the report stated. CHRISTIAN WORSHIP EVENT IN DEEP BLUE CITY FACES FIERCE BACKLASH FROM LGBTQ LEADERS A new study ranks each of the 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., for their regulatory and religious freedom laws impacting religious nonprofits. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Michigan (31%), Washington (35%), Massachusetts (37%), Illinois (38%) and West Virginia (38%), and Maryland (38%) received the lowest overall scores for protecting religious and regulatory freedoms in the report. Michigan and Washington state were among \"the worst places to operate a faith-based nonprofit,\" the report said. These states have several laws that can \"burden\" operations, according to the report, including \"broad\" Blaine Amendments and nondiscrimination laws that may lack robust exemptions for faith-based employers and public-facing ministries. Napa Legal, a nonprofit legal education group that equips religious organizations with tools to protect their missions, said the findings underscored the importance of state-level protections. \"The many religious freedom attacks over the past few years are chilling reminders that without staunch state-level protections for religious freedom, ordinary Americans will suffer, regardless of how supportive the current administration may be,\" Napa Legal Senior Counsel Frank Devito said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"From Catholic priests in Washington to concerned parents in Montgomery County, Maryland — incidents from two of the lowest scoring states on the 2025 Faith and Freedom Index — too many Americans have been forced to spend precious time and money litigating issues that should never have gone to court in the first place,\" he said.

Taylor that Maryland parents can remove their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks if they have religious objections, after a group of parents in Montgomery County brought a federal lawsuit.

I was moving around, though, right? But I could tell he felt that it was a bit awkward.\" The \"Substance\" star — who also shares daughters Rumer Willis and Tallulah Willis with ex-husband Bruce Willis — said she felt Cruise\u0027s discomfort may have stemmed from the ongoing pressure set upon women to choose a family or a career at the time.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! The Trump administration is warning that millions of Americans could lose out on federal food benefits within days if Democrats do not accept Republicans\u0027 plan to end the government shutdown. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it does not have the ability to independently reshuffle funds into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, according to a recent memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"Due to Congressional Democrats’ refusal to pass a clean continuing resolution (CR), approximately 42 million individuals will not receive their SNAP benefits come November 1st,\" the memo said. \"This jeopardizes all SNAP recipients in November, including those that have applied for benefits in the last half of October, and furloughed Federal employees who will not receive their combined October/November benefits.\" FLASHBACK: TED CRUZ PREDICTS BALLOONING OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES NOW AT CENTER OF SHUTDOWN FIGHT Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., right, update reporters following their face-to-face meeting with President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Washington, Monday, Sept. 29, 2025. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo) Democrats had been pressing the Trump administration to use the federal government\u0027s SNAP contingency fund, which they said contains about $5 billion, to cover at least some of the shortfall. It takes about $8 to $9 billion per month to cover all SNAP benefits. But the USDA argued that the emergency funding was not \"legally available\" for use. \"SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits. The contingency fund is not available to support [fiscal year (FY) 2026] regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,\" the memo said. \"Instead, the contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice.\" The department also argued that shuffling existing funds from other areas would harm Americans who rely on those programs.

(Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) \"Transfers from other sources would pull away funding for school meals and infant formula,\" the memo said. \"This Administration will not allow Democrats to jeopardize funding for school meals and infant formula in order to prolong their shutdown.\" USDA emphasized its point with an announcement on its website seen Monday morning that said, \"Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\" \u0027THE PANDEMIC\u0027S OVER\u0027: GOP, DEM SENATORS SPAR ON CAMERA OVER COSTLY OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES \"Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance,\" the department said. A letter signed by nearly all House Democrats sent to the USDA on Friday said the SNAP contingency fund was available \"precisely for this reason.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance. Additionally, while the contingency reserve will not cover November benefits in full, we urge USDA to use its statutory transfer authority or any other legal authority at its disposal to supplement these dollars and fully fund November benefits,\" they wrote. Democrats have said they would not accept any federal funding bill that does not also include an extension of Obamacare subsidies that were enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic — but which are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans\u0027 plan, a short-term extension of FY2025 federal funding called a continuing resolution (CR), passed the House on Sept. 19 but has since stalled in the Senate.

FIRST ON FOX: Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said China has been conducting training missions in the western Pacific aimed at limiting U.S. and allied military access. The exercises reflect Beijing\u0027s effort to expand its anti-access/area-denial, or A2/AD, capabilities – a strategy meant to keep opposing forces from entering or operating freely in nearby regions. The military spokesman for Taiwan – officially known as the Republic of China (ROC) – Lt. Gen. Sun Li-fang, told Fox News Digital in exclusive comments that the armed forces of the independently governed island fully understand the threats posed by China’s expanding military might. Sun said Taiwan has prepared a series of responses if the People\u0027s Liberation Army’s (PLA) provocations escalate into acts of war and has detailed plans to counter and survive a potential Chinese naval blockade.

(Daniel Ceng/AP Photo) Taiwan’s military is on alert for the possibility that Communist China could turn \"training\" or an exercise into an actual war. Some analysts warn that a Chinese blockade would be difficult to break, but Sun said Taiwan has \"holistic plans to breach [any] blockade.\" He added that Taipei would \"urge its allies and like-minded partners to treat any blockade as an act of war that should trigger a coordinated international response,\" noting that shipping disruptions in the seas near Taiwan would have serious effects on the global economy. Sun said Taiwan expects the PLA to continue its campaign of \"hybrid warfare\" or \"gray-zone operations,\" a mix of nonmilitary and paramilitary actions designed to pressure and harass Taiwan without formally declaring war. He warned that the PLA seeks to \"exhaust [Taiwan’s] defense capability and blur the battlespace.\" In this undated file photo released by the Taiwan Ministry of Defense, a Chinese PLA J-16 fighter jet flies in an undisclosed location. (Taiwan Ministry of Defense via AP/File) An example of this can be seen in the near-daily incursions by Chinese warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, resulting in Taiwanese air force jets scrambling to intercept them. The tactic, analysts say, is deliberate – part of a broader effort to wear down Taiwan’s air force, degrade equipment and exhaust Taiwan’s personnel. TAIWAN EYES $15B MILITARY PACKAGE IN SIGNAL TO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IT IS ‘SERIOUS’ ON DEFENSE: REPORT Beijing has never ruled Taiwan for even a single day, and Taiwan’s military insists it will not allow China to dictate the rules of any future conflict. Instead, the island democracy is prioritizing the development of asymmetric warfare, a strategy in which, as Sun put it, \"the weaker party strikes at the weak point of the stronger party with appropriate tactics and weapons in order to gain advantages on the battlefield and change the outcome of the war.\" The spokesperson for the Taiwanese military, Lt. Gen. Sun Li-fang, addresses the media. (Taiwanese Armed Forces) The general said Taiwan’s top priorities are to build asymmetric capabilities, strengthen operational resilience, expand reserve force capacity and improve defenses against gray-zone harassment. To achieve these goals, he said, Taiwan is expanding production and deployment of unmanned and AI-driven systems while dispersing command-and-control networks to make a knockout punch much more difficult. He also noted that Taiwan’s surveillance and reconnaissance units are \"vigilant\" and that they \"exchange intelligence and perspectives on PLA activities with our allies and partners.\" CHINA LAUNCHES LARGE MILITARY DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN TO ISSUE \u0027SEVERE WARNING\u0027 Sun also rejected the idea that Taiwan lacks the will to defend itself and believes people here would strongly resist any attempt by the PRC to take Taiwan by force. Taiwan’s military wants the world to know it is committed to its own defense, Sun said, pointing to the proposed 2026 defense budget, which will exceed 3% of GDP. Furthermore, he said, the government is actively pursuing reforms to make training \"as realistic as possible,\" is expanding reserve forces, and has already extended mandatory military service to one year.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! As the Trump administration makes moves to change the H-1B visa program to benefit American-born workers, Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello backed those efforts in an interview with Fox News Digital while offering his expertise on other issues that need to be addressed with work visas. Vianello told Fox News Digital that one of the \"biggest challenges\" with the current H-1B system is the \"impact\" on college hiring, particularly with computer science and computer engineering graduates. Vianello explained that the unemployment rate for college graduates with those degrees is significantly higher than the average for all college graduates and there is a \"concerning\" level of unemployment with college graduates in IT. \"So that basically means they didn\u0027t need degrees for the jobs that they\u0027re currently in, being significantly under employed,\" Vianello said. \"How does the H-1B visa program impact that? Well, firstly, rough estimates are that there are about 730,000 H-1B holders in the U.S. and about 550,000 dependents. Most of them, in excess of 70% of them, are in IT.\" TRUMP’S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (Reuters/Jason Reed) Vianello went on to explain that data shows H-1B visa holders are paid \"significantly less\" than their counterparts doing equivalent IT roles, which gives them a leg up with employers who are looking to pay less. \"I think it gets a little more broadly than that,\" Vianello said. \"In addition to competing with H-1B visa holders, college graduates, especially in IT, are also competing with OPT visa holders. This is optional practical training, basically an extension of the F-1 visa, which is a student visa, which allows you, if you\u0027re a STEM graduate, to work in the U.S. for three years following your graduation.\" \"Now, the OPT visa holders don\u0027t pay Social Security or Medicare taxes, so they\u0027re automatically 15% cheaper, and they are typically paid 42% less than their U S counterparts. So as a college grad, you\u0027re fighting this three-headed monster. You\u0027re graduating with student debt, you\u0027ve got H-1B visa holders and OPT visa holders who have the ability to take your job and cost an employer significantly less, and then you\u0027re competing with the third one, which is the ability of an employer to simply offshore that work.\" Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa – as a company is required to sponsor the visa – and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country. LABOR DAY CELEBRATION: HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk posted on X last year as a rift inside the MAGA movement was raging on the issue. \"The intention was good around bringing in people with skills and retaining people in the US that are doing skills and are studying in the universities,\" Vianello said. \"But the outcome to college grads that are competing for those roles has been really bad.\" Earlier this year, the Trump administration unveiled a proposal designed to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. The $100,000 fee — a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions — will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached. \"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it’s just not [economical],\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Friday as Trump signed the order. Vianello told Fox News Digital, \"Certainly I think that the $100,000 fee on any new applications is gonna go a long way toward changing behavior, but that\u0027s focused on H-1B.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Sept. 19, 2025. (Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images) \"We\u0027ve seen quite a bit of news recently around changes to the OPT visa program as well in terms of limiting the number of visas and limiting the countries that they come from. That\u0027s gonna have a significant impact on the pipeline of people coming through as well. And so I believe those measures are gonna start changing the behavior of many of the employers.\" The argument from H-1B supporters that the United States is bringing in the \"best and the brightest\" is a sentiment Vianello pushed back on. \"In the last 18 months, according to layoffs.fyi, these large companies have laid off 250,000 tech professionals, but at the same time, the cap for H-1B visas was secured before the end of 2024 for the entire 2025, which is 85,000 people,\" Vianello explained. \"So you\u0027re laying off 250,000 U.S. tech workers, but you\u0027re applying for the maximum cap that you can for H-1B visa holders. That doesn\u0027t make sense. If there\u0027s a shortage of skills, why are you laying off 250,000 people? So you can see the way it\u0027s structured. It\u0027s being used as a labor arbitrage to bring down these large companies\u0027 tech costs.\" Vianello, who came here on a visa, told Fox News Digital he is not opposed to worker visa programs in general, but stressed they shouldn\u0027t leave American workers behind. \"I fully support using visas to attract top-tier technologists to the U.S. I came here on a Specialty Occupation Visa myself, which required my employer to invest significantly to bring me over,\" Vianello said. \"What I oppose is the misuse of programs like H-1B and OPT as tools for labor arbitrage, which undercuts entry-level opportunities for U.S. tech graduates and distorts the talent market.\" Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan and Amanda Macias contributed to this report.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! The U.S. Navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile would put Moscow well within target range if President Donald Trump were to fulfill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request. The Tomahawk has long been one of the most recognizable weapons in America’s arsenal. At $2 million per missile and $6 million per launcher, it can strike up to 1,500 miles into enemy territory. If the United States were to authorize Ukraine to use it, it would mark a dramatic escalation in both capability and psychology. For the first time, Russian forces and strategic sites far beyond the front lines — including inside Russian territory — would fall within reach of a Western-supplied, precision long-range weapon that Moscow has no reliable defense against. Unlike the shorter-range Storm Shadow or ATACMS systems already used by Kyiv, the Tomahawk would give Ukraine the ability to strike targets hundreds of miles inside Russia — air bases, ammunition depots, logistics hubs and naval assets supporting the war in Ukraine. That reach would instantly change the strategic balance.

(Credit: Raytheon) Critically, it would give Ukraine the ability to hit at Russia\u0027s energy industry, which, through exports to nations like China, Iran and India, funds the war effort. Ukraine has used ATACMS systems to strike behind enemy lines in Russian-occupied Ukraine and near Russia’s borders — helicopter shelters, ammunition depots and runways. But even as missiles regularly rain down on Kyiv, its defense forces have not been able to respond in kind to Moscow, leaving the Kremlin hub unscathed and largely secure after three and a half years of war. Recently, Ukraine used U.K.-made Storm Shadow missiles to strike a gun depot in Russia. The U.S. supplies targeting data for the Storm Shadow, and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had lifted a ban on using the missiles to strike inside Russia. \"Transferring Tomahawks to Ukraine would mark a major inflection point for Western support of Ukraine,\" Hudson Institute defense analyst Can Kasapoglu wrote in a recent essay. \"The Tomahawk is one of the most effective missiles in the arsenals of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations.\" Kasapoglu noted that the Tomahawk’s strategic appeal \"lies less in its raw explosive yield and more in its precision.\" For Moscow, the implications would be profound. Russia’s military doctrine has long depended on the assumption that its homeland infrastructure — especially command and logistics networks — would remain beyond direct threat from Western-supplied weapons. The introduction of Tomahawks into Ukrainian hands would destroy that assumption overnight. A Tomahawk cruise missile fired in the Mediterranean Sea, in a 2011 Navy photo. (REUTERS/Jonathan Sunderman/U.S. Navy//Handout) The missile’s ability to fly low and evade radar would make it extremely difficult for Russian defenses to stop. Even advanced systems like the S-400 or S-500, already stretched across multiple fronts, could not guarantee interception. Each missile launched would carry not only destructive power but psychological weight — forcing Russia to divert resources away from its offensive operations in Ukraine to protect bases hundreds of miles away. REBECCA GRANT: HOW TOMAHAWKS WORK AND HOW THEY COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR UKRAINE \"Such a move would inevitably free up airspace for the Ukrainian Air Force’s growing fleet of F-16 aircraft and Western-supplied ground-attack smart munitions,\" Kasapoglu wrote. It would also inject uncertainty into Russian planning. Commanders would have to assume that every major staging area — from Belgorod to the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol — could be targeted. That uncertainty erodes confidence, slows operations, and imposes constant strain on air defense assets. Trump explained on Wednesday why he did not provide Tomahawks to Ukraine despite speculation that he would do so. Putin is testing the boundaries of NATO with aircraft incursions, allied states say. (Ramil Sitdikov/Pool/Reuters ) \"There is a tremendous learning curve with the Tomahawk. It\u0027s a very powerful weapon, very accurate weapon,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"And maybe that\u0027s what makes it so complex. But it will take a year. It takes a year of intense training to learn how to use it, and we know how to use it. And we\u0027re not going to be teaching other people. It will be just too far out into the future.\" Trump also made clear he believes the U.S. has few to spare. \"We need Tomahawks for the United States of America too. We have a lot of them, but we need them.\" The U.S. supply of Tomahawks is classified. But analysts say providing Ukraine with the missiles would weaken preparations for conflict in the Indo-Pacific. \"Tomahawk is one of the few munitions (Patriot is another) that would be useful both in Ukraine and the Western Pacific,\" an analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said. The Department of War has already established a review process to ensure that weapons offered to Ukraine do not weaken what it regards as higher priority needs. \"This review process will almost certainly raise objections to this transfer, and presidential intervention may be required,\" the analysis found. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy told Axios Ukraine would welcome other long-range missiles as well. \"We speak not only about Tomahawks. The U.S. has a lot of similar things that doesn\u0027t require much time for training. I think the way to work with Putin is only through pressure,\" Zelensky said. Earlier in the week, he expressed skepticism that Ukraine could win the war. \"They could still win it. I don’t think they will, but they could still win it,\" Trump told reporters Monday. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Putin’s calculus depends heavily on escalation control — the belief that NATO will stop short of providing weapons capable of directly threatening Russian territory. Tomahawks would shatter that red line. For the Kremlin, it would signal that Washington is prepared to move from containment to punishment — just after Trump triggered sanctions on Russia’s lucrative energy exports. Putin told journalists this week that if Russia were attacked with Western long-range missiles, the response would be \"very serious, if not overwhelming.

In the view of Avik Roy — one of the first and most vocal critics of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare — Republicans and Democrats alike have missed the mark in the healthcare debate that has dragged the government into a 24-day shutdown. \"Both sides are wrong,\" Avik said. \"I’m sympathetic to the Republican view, but it’s a strategic mistake.\" The way Roy sees things, Republican wariness over renewing expanded government subsidies should be directed at the bigger problem behind them. Avik Roy interviews Raj Panjabi at the Forbes Healthcare Summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Dec. 4, 2023, in New York City. (Taylor Hill/Getty Images) \"The subsidies aren’t inherently the problem,\" Roy said. \"If you want low-income people who are near the poverty line to have insurance, you’re going to have to subsidize. Subsidies have been a part of Republican [healthcare] plans and Democratic plans. I would argue that the approach to subsidies that Obamacare used was actually pretty reasonable.\" That doesn’t mean he believes the government’s current healthcare trajectory is sustainable, either. FLASHBACK: TED CRUZ PREDICTS BALLOONING OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES NOW AT CENTER OF SHUTDOWN FIGHT The federal government entered a 24-day shutdown at the beginning of October when lawmakers failed to come to an agreement over spending legislation to begin the new fiscal year. Republicans advanced a short-term spending bill that would have bought more time for lawmakers to finalize funding for 2026. But Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have shot down that measure repeatedly, demanding that Congress first address expiring COVID-era insurance subsidies. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, right, is joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for a press conference in Statuary Hall at the Capitol on Feb. 12. (Rod Lamkey/AP) As a part of its American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration greatly widened the pool of eligible applicants who could receive a federal subsidy to help pay for their Obamacare health insurance. In its original form, Obamacare capped subsidies for anyone making over 400% of the federal poverty level. But that changed in 2021 when, as an emergency response to COVID-19, Congress temporarily removed that cap. The cap will go back into effect at the end of 2025. \u0027THE PANDEMIC\u0027S OVER\u0027: GOP, DEM SENATORS SPAR ON CAMERA OVER COSTLY OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES Findings by KFF, a healthcare policy think tank, indicate that over 90% of the 24 million Obamacare enrollees make use of the expanded credits. Letting them expire could leave those Obamacare enrollees suddenly footing a substantially heftier bill. But, according to the Committee of a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal policy think tank, continuing the policy would also come with a steep price tag; upwards of $30 billion annually. Republicans — especially the Hill’s most fiscally conservative lawmakers — have called for the subsidies to expire to help reel the country’s spending back under control. Despite agreeing with Republicans that Obamacare did little to make health insurance more affordable, Roy believes Republican insistence on letting them expire won’t solve Obamacare’s underlying problems that are driving prices higher: regulations. Roy believes Republicans should use the moment to negotiate, extending the subsidies for maybe one to two years for existing enrollees in exchange for a permanent fix of the costliest Obamacare regulations driving costs upward. OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES AT CENTER OF DEM SHUTDOWN FIGHT \u0027FUEL\u0027 HEALTHCARE COST INFLATION, CONSERVATIVES SAY \"In Switzerland [health insurance] costs $200 a month or $300 a month. The same plan in America costs $1,000 a month or $15,000 a month. Subsidizing it also costs a lot. But having a scale where the subsidy fades out gradually as you go up the income scale — that part is fine.\" Roy praised efforts from the Trump administration to bring the underlying costs of healthcare down, most recently through the most favored nation strategy. Under that plan, the Trump administration had leveraged the price other countries pay for pharmaceuticals to bring U.S. prices down. In theory, the most favored nation plan would set American prices at the lowest rates other countries pay. President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House on Oct. 10, 2025. Trump announced a deal to slash consumer prices on some drugs in exchange for tariff relief. (Shawn Thew/Getty Images) \"They’re not actually deals that truly establish most favored nation status because it\u0027s company by company, and they are on particular drugs. But the general idea — if you want to participate in the U.S. market you’ve got to give us the lowest price you give any other advanced economy — I think that’s eminently reasonable,\" Roy said of the administration’s negotiations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to Democratic demands, Republicans in Congress maintain that the enhanced premium tax credits are completely unrelated to the government’s funding and rejected those demands out of hand. The Senate has voted on a short-term funding bill 12 times since the beginning of the shutdown and appeared no closer to finding a resolution when the lawmakers left town on Thursday. The Senate will return to Washington, D.C., at the beginning of next week. Leo Briceno is a politics reporter for the congressional team at Fox News Digital.

In fact, there was no certainty Fields would even be starting on the road at Paycor Stadium on Sunday, as head coach Aaron Glenn kept his decision close to his chest until Saturday came around. Following his redemption game, Fields revealed that the criticism and pressure to perform truly got to him this week. \"I’m going to get pretty vulnerable right here,\" Fields told reporters, via Yahoo Sports. \"This week, I found myself in my closet crying on the ground, lying down.

The coach didn’t hold anything back either, recognizing the Jets had the Bengals’ defense on its heels and continued to go for two-point conversions on back-to-back touchdown drives in the fourth quarter. Without both being successful, perhaps we’re still talking about a winless Jets team on Monday. But that’s not the case. Instead, the Jets have \"Victory Monday,\" and hope to build off their win as they head into their bye week.

Takaichi’s resume blends her strong brand of conservatism with a rock-and-roll streak while drawing inspiration from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Takaichi, 64, came to power earlier this month after the resignation of former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, following the Liberal Democratic Party’s loss of its upper-house majority in July. Known for her uncompromising views on defense and social issues, Trump\u0027s visit will be her first major diplomatic test.

She reportedly still keeps an electronic drum kit in her Tokyo residence and plays with headphones to unwind after work. Takaichi was also known in her younger years as an avid motorcycle rider. JAPAN CALLS AXIS OF CHINA, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA THE \u0027GRAVEST THREAT\u0027 TO GLOBAL ORDER SINCE WWII In early remarks, Takaichi said she admired Thatcher’s \"strong character and convictions\" and that she met the former British leader at a symposium shortly before Thatcher’s death in 2013. The combination of a conservative politician with a rock-and-roll past — Japan’s first female prime minister behind a drum kit and once on a bike — has helped shape her public image as both disciplined and unconventional.

Her economic policy continues much of Abe’s \"Abenomics,\" emphasizing fiscal expansion and monetary easing — a contrast to Thatcher-style austerity. Yet her assertive tone and ideological discipline echo the British prime minister she idolizes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At home, Takaichi holds staunchly traditional views. She opposes same-sex marriage, rejects allowing separate surnames for married couples and supports the imperial family’s male-only succession, according to The Associated Press.

Trump made the statement during a gaggle with reporters aboard Air Force One, saying he expected to get answers regarding the crashes soon. One possibility he\u0027d been given was that the planes had faulty fuel, the president said. \"You\u0027ve been briefed on the incident, on the Nimitz, both a fighter jet and a helicopter?\" a reporter asked. \"I\u0027ve heard about it, yeah,\" Trump responded.

(Yonhap/Reuters) Two U.S. Navy aircraft from USS Nimitz — a Sea Hawk helicopter and an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet — crashed during separate \"routine operations\" over the South China Sea on Sunday. All five crew members aboard the two craft were rescued and remain in stable condition, according to the Navy. The U.S. Pacific Fleet — the Navy’s largest operational command — said in a post on X that around 2:54 p.m. local time, an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter assigned to the \"Battle Cats\" of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73 crashed in the South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68). Search-and-rescue teams from Carrier Strike Group 11, operating alongside the Nimitz, quickly launched recovery efforts and safely pulled all three helicopter crew members from the water.

The Cleveland Browns were hoping to string together their first win streak of the season on Sunday after a dominant Week 7 performance against the Miami Dolphins, but the New England Patriots had another thing in mind. Cleveland struggled again offensively in the 32-13 loss to New England in Massachusetts, as rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel threw two interceptions as well as two touchdowns in the loss that looked close until a 21-point third quarter for New England. Browns All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett had an eye-popping individual performance, securing five sacks on quarterback Drake Maye.

He’s getting sick of hearing the same questions each week after the game about how the offense isn’t backing up stellar defensive performances. \"It doesn\u0027t get any easier each week you ask me,\" Garrett responded to a reporter’s question on the matter. \"I would throw the whole performance away for a win.\" Garrett’s performance was a franchise record, as no Browns player had ever recorded five sacks in a single game before. But instead of celebrating a brilliant day on the line of scrimmage, he was spotted slamming his helmet down in frustration on the Browns sideline. BROWNS\u0027 MYLES GARRETT SLAMS HELMET IN FRUSTRATION DESPITE HISTORY-MAKING GAME Garrett’s second sack of the day set a new bar for pass rushers under the age of 30, as he hit the 108.5-sack mark to surpass Reggie White for the record, according to Cleveland.com. Garrett’s talent is undeniable, but he made it clear this offseason that the chance to compete for a Super Bowl is what drives him.

(Brian Fluharty/Imagn Images) It was a tumultuous offseason for the star edge rusher, as it began with him requesting a trade in February following yet another lackluster Browns campaign in 2024. Garrett was looking for a contract extension at the time. \"As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl – and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" he said in a statement. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today. \"While I’ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won’t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.\" Browns GM Andrew Berry was steadfast in not wanting to trade Garrett, and about one month later, both sides came to an agreement on a massive four-year extension worth $123 million, which was a record at the time of signing. Garrett had a \"change of heart,\" according to his agent, and was committed to helping the Browns move forward with the hopes of a Vince Lombardi trophy heading to Cleveland.

In late September 2017, Palestinian American activist Linda Sarsour, once the darling of the Women’s March and the self-declared face of the \"resistance\" against Donald Trump, was facing mounting criticism for antisemitic remarks and her embrace of extremist views. But, beaming in a photograph taken on a city sidewalk, Sarsour appeared unfazed, her iconic fist pumped in the air as she knelt shoulder-to-shoulder with campaign volunteers for City Council candidate Khader El-Yateem. The photo was posted by El-Yateem on the Facebook page he used to promote his campaign, which he lost, but among the smiling faces was a young organizer named Zohran Mamdani. In late September 2017, Palestinian American pastor Khader El-Yateem shared a photo of his campaign team from his bid to be elected to New York\u0027s City Council from Brooklyn\u0027s District 43. Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour (far left, front row) took a knee with Zohran Mamdani (fourth from right, white shirt). El-Yattem lost the race. (@Khader El-Yateem/Facebook) (@Khader El-Yateem/Facebook) That photo would mark the start of a carefully constructed political project that, in less than a decade, would propel a now-34-year-old socialist newcomer to the precipice of running America’s largest city – even while campaigning with radical imams, some of whom have supported terrorists and terrorist financiers. A Fox Digital investigation reveals that Mamdani’s rise was no accident. It was engineered. SEN.

(AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis, Pool) A database of 110 groups backing Mamdani exposes a tight inner circle of organizations that identify as Muslim or socialist, working hand-in-glove with 76 Democratic Party affiliates, allied groups and unions. Particularly important in this political machine are two networks – Sarsour’s MPower organizations and another constellation of groups called Emgage, with which she works closely. The organizations have been generously funded. In total, billionaire George Soros’s Open Society philanthropies have given MPower and Emgage nearly $2.5 million in recent years, according to tax filings. \"#MyMuslimVote Organizing Summit\" with Zohran Mamdani, then the Democratic nominee for the 36th District to New York\u0027s General Assembly, Women\u0027s March cofounder Tamika Mallory and former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed.

( MPower Change/email) \"We fund a range of civil society organizations that work to deepen civic engagement through peaceful democratic participation, counter discrimination including against Muslim Americans and advance human rights,\" a spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Fox News Digital. \"The grants that you cite all occurred years before the mayoral race, and we are a nonpartisan organization that does not fund political candidates and their campaigns.\" Mamdani, Sarsour and the groups supporting Mamdani\u0027s campaign didn\u0027t return requests for comment. MPower and Emgage have been part of a tight inner circle of 30 ethnic and religious groups, that also includes CAIR Action, the 501(c)(4) political wing of the 501(c)(3) Council on American-Islamic Relations nonprofit, the Islamic Circle of North America,\" \"Muslim Action Coalition,\" Yemeni American Merchants Associations Inc., the \"Bangladeshi American Advocacy Group\" and \"Desis Rising Up and Moving.\" They have pumped up Mamdani’s campaign with social media campaigns, canvassing, voters and buzz. Altogether, they have annual revenues of about $24 million, and they have worked to promote Mamdani’s campaign with endorsements, fund-raising, social media campaigns and canvassing. The result: a carefully constructed political career that mainstreams the socialist goals long embraced by Sarsour and fellow members of the Democratic Socialists of America. It’s a machine that is expressing itself in races from New York to Virginia, Minnesota, Texas and California with MPower and Emgage aligning with the Democratic Socialists of America and the Democratic Party to propel candidates who may share their views. In a campaign called \"Defend and Advance,\" Emgage SuperPac is pushing Mamdani and Democratic Virginia Lt. Governor candidate Ghazala Hashmi as its \"star candidates.\" Emgage’s \"Defend and Advance\" roster of supported candidates and office holders includes Dearborn, Mich., Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. \"I want you to know as mayor, you are not welcome here,\" Hammoud recently told a Christian pastor who objected to a proposal to name a street in honor of a local man who had allegedly praised terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. \"And the day you move out of the city will be the day that I launch a parade celebrating the fact that you moved out of the city because you are not somebody who believes in coexistence.\" Emgage’s donations include $175,000 from a group little-noticed by political observers but important in Islamist circles: Sterling Charitable Gift Fund, based in Herndon, Va. It is part of a network of groups that FBI agents raided in 2002 as part of wider investigations into the funding of Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas. Federal prosecutors ultimately didn’t file criminal charges against any officials at Sterling Charitable Gift Fund.

(FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) Over almost a decade, Sarsour and her allies have orchestrated a network of well-financed and tightly connected socialist activists, radical imams, political organizers and nonprofit organizations funded with millions of dollars by major philanthropies including Foundation to Promote Open Society, the Ford Foundation, Macarthur Foundation and the Tides Foundation. The confluence of big philanthropy, partisan operatives and clerical authority has helped drive Mamdani’s ascent. Its architecture combines nonprofit activism with faith-based politics and the precision of a professional campaign operation. \"To the casual observer, Zohran Mamdani’s rise might appear meteoric – a story of grassroots energy and demographic change in America’s largest city,\" said Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American Muslim who is running against Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, with Omar supported by the same kind of political machine being unleashed to propel Mamdani to office. \"The data, the money trail and the affiliations, from the Democratic Socialists of America to the Islamists, tells a different story.\" \"Mamdani’s ascent is the product of deliberate design: a sophisticated collaboration between socialist activism and Islamist organizing, lubricated by millions in foundation grants and political donations and normalized through a revolving door of political operatives and nonprofits who embrace Islamists, the destruction of the state of Israel and hostilities to the police, the U.S. and the West,\" Al-Aqidi said. The timeline of Mamdani’s rise tracks precisely with the growth of this network. In 2012, as a student at Bowdoin College, in Maine, he cofounded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, the campus organization known for its rabid anti-Israel activism. By 2017, he was canvassing for El-Yateem’s campaign with Sarsour’s mentorship.

(Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) In 2018, Mamdani formally entered Sarsour’s orbit through the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, an organization she co-founded in 2013 to mobilize Muslim voters and elect progressive Democrats to local office. The Muslim Democratic Club of New York served as both incubator and amplifier for Sarsour’s political brand, one that fused progressive politics with an explicitly Islamist social identity. By December 2018, Mamdani joined the board, in an announcement in which the group said, \"Help build Muslim power across the city with us!\" UNEARTHED VIDEO EXPOSES MAMDANI\u0027S \u0027UNABASHED\u0027 COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING ANTI-ISRAEL SANCTIONS AS LAWMAKER Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani supporters gather outside 30 Rock in New York City on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. (Fox News Digital/Deirdre Heavey) With his new role, Mamdani gained access to an emerging infrastructure of influence: voter lists, donor networks and organizing muscle that would later power his campaign to a seat on the New York General Assembly. The Muslim Democratic Club endorsed Mamdani. Around that time, Sarsour was building her own empire, founding MPower Change as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit housed at Neo Philanthropy Inc. Public filings show MPower Change took in at least $2.4 million between 2017 and 2024, the latest year available, with Soros’s Foundation to Promote Open Society giving her organization $1.125 million and the Macarthur Foundation funneling her $450,000. It would become a flagship digital organizing hub for not just Sarsour but Mamdani. Meanwhile, Emgage Action was expanding its footprint nationally. Also backed by the Open Society network, Emgage Action received a share of $42.5 million that Soros\u0027 foundations pledged to Muslim, Arab and South Asian civic groups beginning in 2021. It has received $1.8 million from the Open Society Policy Center and another $1.35 million from the Foundation to Promote Open Society. Together, MPower Change and Emgage created an unprecedented financial and political ecosystem, leveraging big philanthropy’s dollars and digital strategy to elevate candidates like Mamdani under the banner of Muslim empowerment. In 2020, Mamdani won his first election to the New York State Assembly, with Sarsour’s explicit endorsement and fundraising help. By 2020, Mamdani was being featured in Sarsour’s #MyMuslimVote summit, promoted by MPower Change as the face of a new generation of unapologetic Muslim progressives. By this year, his campaign for mayor became the culmination of that project — backed by PAC money, boosted by clerical endorsements and legitimized by an activist ecosystem that had spent a decade grooming him for this very moment. REP. ELISE STEFANIK LABELS NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI A \u0027JIHADIST\u0027 New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, spoke to supporters at a canvass launch event in Prospect Park on Sunday, Aug. 17, 2025. (Deirdre Heavey/Fox News Digital) To push Mamdani toward the helm of the nation’s biggest city, the network extended far beyond activist circles. Central to Mamdani’s political ascent was a series of carefully cultivated relationships with clerics with some troubling views. In January, Mamdani courted Imam Muhammad Al-Barr of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, visiting his mosque just months after Al-Barr had publicly prayed to \"annihilate\" Israel. In May, Imam Siraj Wahhaj, the longtime imam of Brooklyn’s Masjid Al-Taqwa, personally donated $1,000 to the Unity and Justice Fund. More recently, Mamdani met with Wahhaj and called him \"one of the nation’s foremost Muslim leaders and a pillar of the Bed-Stuy community.\" Wahhaj, who served as a character witness in the trial of Omar Abdel-Rahman, the \"Blind Sheikh\" later convicted of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has a long history of calling for the exploitation of America’s democracy to further a conquest for Islam. \"You don\u0027t get in politics because it\u0027s the American thing to do,\" he said in a videotaped 1991 sermon. \"You get involved in politics because politics can be a weapon to use in the cause of Islam.\" Wahhaj has also denounced the U.S. government as \"controlled by Shaitan,\" the Arabic word for the devil, urged Muslims not to befriend \"non-believers,\" condemned homosexuality as \"a disease of this society,\" and supported Islamic laws that punish sex outside of marriage with 100 lashes and stoning. In 2011, Wahhaj urged Muslims to donate to the legal defense of the since-convicted Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist dubbed \"Lady Al Qaeda\" for attempting to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Over the years, Wahhaj’s sermons have praised \"jihad\" without \"a gun,\" called for an Islamic America governed by sharia law and urged the creation of an \"army of 10,000 men in New York City.\" Other imams now backing Mamdani’s mayoral run have also been controversial. Imam Talib Abdur-Rashid, a cleric leading the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, co-founded the Muslim Alliance in North America, alongside Wahhaj. In 2005, Abdur-Rashid publicly defended Rafiq Sabir, an American doctor who joined Al Qaeda and was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison.

(AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis, Pool) In 2008, Abdur-Rashid defended Sami Al-Arian, a Palestinian American professor whom the U.S. later deported to Turkey for \"conspiring to provide services\" to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Still in the U.S., Al-Arian’s wife joined the anti-Israel encampments at Columbia University. In September, Mamdani appeared as the special guest speaker at Abdur-Rashid’s annual gala. A month earlier, Muslim Association of North America’s social media featured Abdur-Rashid visiting Wahhaj’s mosque, underscoring the continued collaboration between the two imams. In Manhattan, Imam Khalid Latif, the executive director of the Islamic Center at New York University, has been another prominent Mamdani backer. Latif publicly endorsed Mamdani on Facebook in June, calling him \"a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare.\" In 2012, Latif led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen and he hasn’t faced the same type of allegations that surround the other imams. Zohran Mamdani meets Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Yusef Abdus Salaam on Oct. 17, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani/X) For many Muslim political organizations backing Mamdani, these clerics are not liabilities but assets, serving as trusted gatekeepers to the city’s growing community of Muslim voters. After Mamdani visited Wahhaj’s mosque earlier this month, he tweeted out a photo of the two with the caption: \"Pleasure to meet Imam Siraj Wahhaj, one of the nation’s foremost Muslim leaders.\" When a firestorm ensued, several allies rose to his defense: Sarsour, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the leaders at Emgage Action. Sarsour shared a selfie with Mamdani, beaming, like they did back in 2017, and wrote, \"May Allah continue to bless and protect you.\" A defiant Wa\u0027el Alzayat, the executive director of Emgage Action, sent out a dispatch to followers on Tuesday, amid criticism for their political work, promising, \"We are in this for the long haul.\" Back in Minnesota, Al-Aqidi closely watched the defense of Mamdani. \"For over a decade, Linda Sarsour and her network of allies have built the Mamdani machine piece by piece: the institutions, the donors, the narratives and now, the candidate. There was no way they were going to throw him under the bus for one photo with one imam whom they happen to love,\" said Al-Aqidi. \"Mamdani is the fresh face of a radical coalition, and I hope New Yorkers will reject him. Win or lose, one fact remains undeniable. His rise was not spontaneous. It was engineered and the machinery behind it is only getting stronger.\" Al-Aqidi said; \"I hope New Yorkers will shut the Mamdani machine down.\" Asra Q.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Two Utah attorneys say newly appointed Judge Tony Graf will bring fairness, experience and steady leadership to the state’s most closely watched murder trial, a case one calls \"the biggest legal case in Utah history.\" Defense attorney Skye Lazaro told Fox News Digital she expects Graf to approach the high-profile proceedings involving Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, with diligence and balance. \"He’s very conscientious… very fair,\" Lazaro said. \"I would expect that he’s going to take his oath of office very seriously in working through this case.\" Graf, a longtime Utah prosecutor before his appointment to the bench, will oversee the capital case against Robinson, accused in the high-profile killing of the Turning Point USA founder. Lazaro, who has known Graf professionally for years, said his background provides valuable experience but doesn’t compromise impartiality.

(Scott G. Winterton/Pool via Deseret News) \"He does have familiarity with the criminal justice system. I don’t think that’s going to impact his rulings one way or another,\" she said. \"He’ll decide fairly, the best he can, based on what’s in front of him.\" Attorney Nathan Evershed, who is not connected to the Robinson case but previously worked alongside Graf, told Fox News Digital: \"This case is not only big, it literally could be the biggest legal case in Utah history. There’s not really been a case like this of such not only national but international significance.\" He noted that Graf had \"less than two months on the bench\" when he was assigned the case, calling the appointment \"apparently… randomly allocated.\" Evershed, who served with Graf at the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, described him as \"very diligent, very hardworking,\" someone who \"got there early, understood his cases and really cared about doing the right thing.\" WHAT WILL BE TYLER ROBINSON’S DEFENSE STRATEGY?

(Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News via AP, Pool) While Graf lacks judicial experience, Evershed said he brings \"years and thousands of hours of courtroom experience\" from his time as a prosecutor. \"He’s gone to trial many times… He was a prosecutor for many, many years,\" he said. Evershed called the case a \"career-defining moment\" not just for Graf but for \"literally everyone that’s involved in this case.\" \"It’s gonna be something that’s gonna be in the news for a long time, especially here in Utah,\" he said. \"I have no doubt that this will go to trial… several weeks long and… highly scrutinized.\" WATCH: Attorney says newly appointed judge faces intense spotlight in Charlie Kirk assassination case Video Lazaro emphasized that Graf’s commitment to judicial balance, between victims’ rights and a defendant’s constitutional protections, will be critical in a case already saturated with public attention. \"All judges… take their oath very seriously,\" she said. \"Part of that is being unbiased and making rulings based on the facts and the law… I would expect that he’s going to do the very best job he can to be impartial and uphold his duty to the office.\" Lazaro described Utah County’s growing number of death penalty filings as \"somewhat unique or unlucky\" for a newly appointed judge to face so early in his tenure.

Spencer Cox) \"There’s a really steep learning curve going from practicing law to being on the bench,\" she said. \"But that doesn’t mean he won’t do a good job… this case is going to be under scrutiny for years.\" Lazaro noted that capital cases impose intense professional and personal strain, not only on attorneys and court staff but also on the judges who preside over them. \"Death penalty cases are hard… and when you add in media and political pressure — and calls for the death penalty early on — it makes it that much harder,\" she said. \"It takes a toll on everybody involved.\" Despite the case’s national attention, Lazaro said a change of venue is improbable. \"I wouldn’t expect that this case would change venue unless the defense moves for it or there’s a conflict,\" Lazaro said. \"You’re not gonna get a more favorable jury with a change of venue because it’s nationally known… everybody’s talking about this case.\" While acknowledging the challenges, Lazaro expressed confidence in Graf’s capability and fairness. \"Anyone appointed to the bench is deemed competent and experienced enough to handle any type of case,\" they said. \"I wouldn’t want to be in his shoes, but I expect he’ll do the very best job he can.\" EX-US ATTORNEY WARNS PROSECUTORS COULD FACE MANY HURDLES IN CASE AGAINST CHARLIE KIRK\u0027S ALLEGED KILLER The exterior of the Fourth Judicial Court where Tyler Robinson appeared via video for his first court appearance in Provo, Utah, Tuesday, September 16, 2025.

I think he has a very strong presence as well. He’s someone that doesn’t easily back down from his convictions.\" He said that will serve Graf well as the case unfolds under intense national attention and likely \"years of appellate review.\" \"This is a death penalty case,\" Evershed said. \"Should the death penalty be enacted, this will be a case that will be highly scrutinized in terms of judicial rulings, orders, reviews, rulings on evidence.\" \"Your heart just really goes out to him,\" Evershed added. \"You would hope to have at least 10 years of experience on the bench to handle this kind of quagmire. In this case, he had less than two months.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"I believe Judge Graf reflects well on the Utah Judiciary,\" he said. \"He’s an experienced lawyer.

He is someone that likes to show respect to everybody in the courtroom.\" \"He’s not someone that’s gonna prematurely put his thumb on the scale for certain outcomes,\" Evershed added. \"He understands his role… of judicial restraint and making sure that things are handled appropriately.\" Evershed said the case will be long and complex, but believes Graf is prepared for the challenge. \"The amount of hearings… the amount of motions that are going to be filed… we can’t even calculate that,\" he said. \"It’s going to take a long, long road, but eventually we’ll get there.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the Utah Administrative Office of the Courts.

Climate protesters have grown more confrontational in recent years, experts say, including publicly cataloging energy sector leaders and conservatives as \"climate criminals,\" staging disruptive protests outside conservative organizations in the U.S., while climate activists in the U.K. have gone as far as attempting citizen\u0027s arrests of water company CEOs. \"It\u0027s been getting worse during the 21st Century, ever since Bush vs. Gore in the year 2000,\" Heritage Foundation\u0027s director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, told Fox News Digital. \"Before that, I think that the relations were better and that they\u0027ve been gradually getting worse. It seems to be worse, worse every year. I would say, and I think partly the year 2000, it\u0027s also where there was more access to the internet in general.\" Climate activists have increasingly become more confrontational in splashy and often costly acts of protests, including throwing soup at glass protecting the \"Mona Lisa\" at the Louvre in Paris while protesting food insecurity in 2024, vandalizing Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate in 2023 with orange paint while calling on the German government to stop using all fossil fuels by 2030, and a yearslong international campaign that has vandalized and deflated thousands of tires on SUVs since 2021. Fox News Digital took a look back at how climate protests have intensified in recent years, most notably in Europe, and how the activism is also playing out on U.S. soil and in the court system. SCALISE LEADS GOP FIGHT AT SCOTUS TO STOP \u0027RADICAL\u0027 LEFT’S ‘WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY’ A climate protester scales the Wilson Building as part of an Earth Day rally against fossil fuels April 22, 2022. (Getty Images) In the U.K. earlier in October, a group of female climate activists were seen surrounding water company CEO Mark Thurston near a train station in London while trying to place him under a citizen\u0027s arrest for \"charges\" of public nuisance related to environmental damage and sewage spills. The women surrounded the CEO of Anglian Water and linked their arms together before he was seen jumping into a cab. The attempted citizen\u0027s arrest followed another similar incident in the U.K. in March, when climate protesters attempted to place Thames Water\u0027s CEO and chief financial officer under citizen\u0027s arrest on suspicion of causing a public nuisance over illegal discharge of sewage and other alleged issues, The Guardian reported at the time. Confrontational and destructive protests have not played out at the same pace in the U.S. as Europe, but stateside protests also have swelled in recent years. \"For the past few months, we’ve had protesters in front of Heritage,\" Furchtgott-Roth told Fox News Digital about the conservative think tank\u0027s office in Washington, D.C. \"We had to hire extra security, and it’s not just the front entrance, but it’s also the back entrance,\" she added. \"They know all the entrances to our building.\" The climate expert and economist explained that the proliferation of internet accessibility since 2000 has sparked climate protesters to become more confrontational, as activists push the limits of what they say online and are better able to coordinate with like-minded individuals. The Heritage Foundation\u0027s president is also among a lengthy list of individuals identified as \"climate criminals\" in a public directory of dozens of individuals stretching from Trump administration officials to oil company CEOs. The directory claims those listed \"have played historical and present roles in perpetuating climate destruction.\" \"Certain criminals have been awarded specific titles based on the nature of their crimes. Climate criminals designated as ‘Oilgarchs’ are members of Trump’s Cabinet or Mega-donors with explicit ties to the fossil fuel industry. Climate criminals designated with a \u0027Lifetime Achievement\u0027 award are actors who have earned a spot in our ‘Hall of Shame’ for their role in driving climate destruction over the last couple decades,\" the climate directory states. Climate demonstrators protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand on Feb. 20, 2024, in London. (Leon Neal/Getty Images) The website states it does not call for violence against those identified, instead championing \"nonviolent witness and protest with the goal of promoting legal and voluntary changes in behavior.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the group for additional comment but did not immediately receive a reply. SUPREME COURT MUST FREEZE THE CLIMATE EXTORTION OF OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY Furchtgott-Roth said Europe\u0027s heightened climate protests are more severe than in the U.S., pointing to European censorship overall as an issue. \"Look at what\u0027s happened in Birmingham in the UK, where they\u0027re telling supporters of the Israeli football team that they cannot attend the game because they cannot protect. That\u0027s a lot worse than what we have here,\" she said, referring to a ban on Israeli soccer club fans from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham, England, in November over security concerns. The economist and climate expert continued that the political climate overall is tenuous, pointing to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO in 2024. \"I think everyone has to be careful with the CEO of UnitedHealthcare getting killed on the streets of New York, not to mention Charlie Kirk. But I mean the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he\u0027s not a known Republican or Democrat, he\u0027s just CEO going around his business,\" she said. \"The world has gotten more confrontational, and I think this has real costs in security.\" The mounting climate protests come as U.S. energy industry leaders face an onslaught of cases that GOP lawmakers are warning could bankrupt the industry and put the U.S.\u0027 national security at risk. Climate protests have become more confrontational in recent years, most notably in the EU. ( David Cantiniaux/AFPTV / AFP/Getty Images) \"Every day, hardworking Americans depend on access to affordable and reliable energy,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a comment provided to Fox News Digital earlier in October. \"Despite this, radical environmentalists and local leftist politicians continue to wage war on American energy by going after domestic energy companies in our courtrooms, demanding they meet impossible standards or pay billions in damages. Any regulation of global greenhouse emissions falls squarely within the federal government\u0027s jurisdiction.\" Dozens of House lawmakers signed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in October calling for the Supreme Court to end lawsuits originating in Colorado that seek compensation from Exxon and Suncor Energy, arguing it\u0027s a federal issue, not a state matter. The lawmakers wrote that the case is one steeped in national security and stability concerns, arguing it could throttle the American energy industry, \"if not bankrupt it altogether.\" TOP ENERGY GROUP CALLS FOR PROBE INTO SECRETIVE \u0027NATIONAL LAWFARE CAMPAIGN\u0027 TO INFLUENCE JUDGES ON CLIMATE Similar suits have also originated in Massachusetts, New York, Delaware and elsewhere. President Donald Trump also has railed against climate change as the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" during a UN speech in September. \"All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,\" Trump added. The Biden administration frequently championed climate change initiatives, with former President Joe Biden warning that global warming was the \"ultimate threat to humanity.\" For liberal politicians and lawmakers, climate change remains a top priority during the off-season election year and as Washington, D.C., eyes the midterms in 2026.

(AP/Jon Elswick) \"I’ve seen firsthand what the reports made clear: the devastating toll of climate change and its existential threat to all of us. And it is the ultimate threat to humanity: climate change,\" Biden said in a 2023 speech addressing the \"climate crisis.\" \"Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. The impacts we’re seeing are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious, and more costly,\" he added. Furchtgott-Roth said American companies are also facing legal challenges from across the Atlantic as European Union directives. \"The European Union is taking a very strong stance against American companies. So there is now what\u0027s called CSDDD, corporate sustainability due diligence directive. Which says that as of 2029, any company that does business in the EU with more than $500 million of revenue, is going to have to abide by net-zero solutions,\" she explained. \"And declare its climate emissions, the climate emissions of its contractors, the climate emissions of its subcontractors, which is practically impossible to do accurately. And if it doesn\u0027t do it accurately, there\u0027s a fine.

And so, I got a lot of backlash.\" Robertson Huff said the online criticism hit harder because much of it came from people she thought would be in her corner. \"It was a lot from the church, which is disappointing because I felt like it just, instead of being unifying, we just added so much division and hate,\" she admitted.

Trump’s five-day Asia tour will include talks with Japan’s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Tokyo and a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the final stop in South Korea.

The administration has signaled an interest in expanding semiconductor and critical minerals partnerships with Japan and South Korea to counter China’s dominance in global supply chains. The Trump administration said Sunday that the world’s two largest economies are close to reaching an agreement to avert a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with both sides expected to meet in person soon. The Trump administration has previously singled out China’s dependence on Iranian and Russian oil as sticking points in trade discussions.

As part of the agreement, Thailand agreed to release 18 Cambodian soldiers held captive and for both countries to begin removing heavy artillery from their shared border. The Thai prime minister called the signing of a ceasefire deal \"the building blocks for a lasting peace,\" and Cambodia\u0027s prime minister described the events as a \"historic day.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,\" Trump said.

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern claims America\u0027s next health revolution is in the seafood section of the grocery store. In an interview with Fox News Digital, the \"Bizarre Foods\" host and James Beard Award-winning chef said one of the most dangerous habits of Americans today is that they\u0027re neglecting fish. \"Seafood is the healthiest protein in general … from digestion to brain health to brain growth for younger people and on and on,\" Zimmern said. The Minnesota-based chef said seafood is \"extremely beneficial\" to the body. AMERICA\u0027S NEXT HEALTH REVOLUTION STARTS IN THE KITCHEN — AND AROUND THE DINNER TABLE \"It\u0027s very low in fat, in general — and what fats that are there are very, very healthy ones.\" In Zimmern\u0027s new \"Blue Food Cookbook,\" co-written with fellow chef Barton Seaver, he says a simple shift in American diets could have ripple effects for public health, the environment and the economy. Chef Andrew Zimmern told Fox News Digital that Americans aren\u0027t eating enough seafood.

We should be keeping more of that seafood here at home.\" Andrew Zimmern, at left, and Barton Seaver, right, are co-authors of the new \"Blue Food Cookbook.\" (Eric Wolfinger) By creating more demand for seafood, the price would drop, more people would eat it and \"human beings would be healthier,\" Zimmern said. BEEF INDUSTRY SLAMS LAB-GROWN HYBRID MEAT AS SCIENTISTS PROMISE GREENER STEAKS Part of the problem, he said, is the illusion of cheap meat. \"I\u0027m eating less and less [red meat] as every year goes by, but I love it.\" \"We have been almost hypnotized, in a way, in this country to assume that a steak of a certain size, individually portioned, wrapped in plastic in the supermarket, should cost $8 or $9,\" Zimmern said. \"And that was the case for 40, 50 years.

Getty Images The Issue: Demolition on the White House’s East Wing to build a privately financed $300 million ballroom. Few photos in recent memory have caused quite as much controversy as the one showing the White House’s East Wing being partially demolished to make room for President Trump’s big, beautiful ballroom (“Billionaires’ ‘ball,’ ” Oct. 24). Is it possible, if not likely, that while viewing this photo, the people are actually seeing the demolition of our democracy with the same ease as the defacing of America’s most iconic landmark? Bob Ory Chicago, Ill. Democrats and their sycophant media puppets are upset about the White House’s demolition for a ballroom because there was so much history in the old East Wing.

Some of the most iconic figures appeared in thrilling games, concerts and other events at the historic stadium. Wayne Galvin Lynbrook The dictionary simply defines “ballroom” as “a large room for dancing.” Trump has a lot of nerve spending $300 million to build himself a ballroom — which he falsely said in July “won’t interfere with the current building” — just to show off his embarrassing, stationary, arm-moves-only “dance” to the song “YMCA.” Richard Siegelman Plainview The news showed yet another pile of grey concrete and rubble, the result of a battle. This time, however, the destroyed building was the East Wing of the White House. The war is Trump against good taste, the dignity of his position and the symbolism of the building he works in. A history of the White House would be an interesting read in the future, but at least one chapter will have a content warning to prepare the reader for the horror of damage done to the building. Dennis Fitzgerald Melbourne, Australia The usual suspects are getting their panties in a bunch over Trump’s ballroom. Funny how I never heard a peep, simply praise, over former President Obama’s basketball court. Thomas De Julio Delray Beach, Fla. Demolition crews have begun work on the East Wing of the White House. Instead of housing the First Lady’s office and other administration staff, it will be replaced by a ballroom. Don’t be surprised when 12” x 12” remnants from the old building are sold as keepsakes. I’m guessing the amount raised will exceed copies of Trump’s Bible or pairs of his sneakers. Denny Freidenrich Laguna Beach, Calif. The Issue: President Trump increasing tariffs on Canada by 10% after Ontario aired an anti-tariff ad. As a punishment for trying to shame the Trump administration into abandoning tariffs on Canadian imports, President Trump slapped an additional 10% on our northern trading partner (“Prez ‘ads’ 10% to Canada tariff,” Oct. 26). I find it bizarre that Canada’s approach to winning the tariff argument was replaying out-of-context parts of a Reagan 1987 radio address. If Canada’s leaders truly believe in Reagan’s words, why don’t they simply “reject their protectionist legislation” by repealing tariffs on US goods? Luana Dunn Glen Burnie, Md.

We’re going to go back and we’re going to self-scout as far as coaches and we’re going to talk to the players about things, about the good, bad, the ugly, and the solutions, also, for us moving forward. So, there’s a good and a bad to it.” The Jets shocked the Bengals on Sunday with a 39-38 victory after trailing by 15 points entering the fourth quarter. It was the team’s best offensive performance. But they must wait until Nov. 9, when they face the Browns at MetLife Stadium to see if they can build off it. Aaron Glenn picked up by the Jets in the locker room after their first win. @nyjets “Obviously, after you get a win you want to continue going,” Glenn said, “but I also know that there’s some things that we have to reflect on and try to continue to fix, and understand, there’s a foundation that we’re trying to create and that is an ongoing process. And we feel good about that.

Williams’ impact could be felt. “He’s just a spitball of energy,” Phillips said. “I remember when I first talked to you guys about having to change my style of play a little bit it was because I was thinking about how fast he comes down and pulls the double teams off. It was cool to see him shoot through a gap and get a major [tackle for loss] in the game and just do the things that he does. He is energy. I can feel his passion at practice.

Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) quick endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris — and he let it be known in a phone call with the former House speaker, according to a new book. Pelosi described Harris as “brilliantly astute” and expressed “full confidence” that the ex-California senator could defeat President Trump in her endorsement statement, which came less than 24 hours after Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid. Obama, who preferred to let “a process” determine Trump’s Democratic Party opponent, called Pelosi shortly after her endorsement to vent his frustration — having thought they were on the same page, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl wrote in “Retribution,” out Tuesday. “The Obamas were not happy,” a Pelosi confidant told Karl, according to an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail. “This person summed up Obama’s message to Pelosi as, essentially, ‘What the f–k did you just do?’” 3 Obama’s reaction to Pelosi’s endorsement of Kamala Harris is detailed in ABC journalist Jonathan Karl’s upcoming book, “Retribution.” Getty Images Explore More Biden refused to speak with Obama for weeks before and after dropping out: book DNC pays off $1.6M in debt for Kamala Harris’ failed campaign as Dems face tight race in New Jersey Hunter Biden says watching Obama lead Joe off stage at infamous Hollywood fundraiser ‘really pissed me off’: book It has been widely reported that the 44th president wanted an open convention to determine the party’s nominee, rather than anointing Harris after Biden’s shocking drop-out. Obama reportedly had serious concerns about Harris’ competence and her ability to beat Trump in the general election. “That train has left the station,” Pelosi reportedly told Obama during their call, according to Karl, apparently referring to Biden’s quick endorsement of Harris after announcing his decision to end his campaign. Karl wrote that Obama and Pelosi both “agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged.” “Therefore, Obama and Pelosi — arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party — had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements,” the journalist claimed. The pair had been in “regular communication” leading up to Biden’s July 21, 2024, withdrawal announcement, which is why Obama was so stunned by Pelosi’s decision to back Harris. 3 Harris was endorsed by Obama five days after Biden dropped out of the race — while Pelosi backed her less than 24 hours after former President Joe Biden withdrew. Tamara Beckwith/NY Post 3 Pelosi reportedly agreed with Obama that an open primary was needed once Biden bowed out. AP A source close to Obama described the former president’s conversation with Pelosi as “’good-natured ribbing,” rather than heated, according to Karl. “The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn’t he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?” Karl writes. However, the source close to Pelosi felt Obama sounded “genuinely irritated” on the call. At least one Biden official believed that Obama, who waited five days after the then-81-year-old president dropped out to endorse Harris, didn’t think the former vice president could win. “There’s only one Black Jesus,” the senior Biden adviser told Karl. Like Obama, Pelosi’s husband was also surprised by the former House speaker’s decision. “Kamala?” Paul Pelosi asked his wife, according to Karl. To which Nancy Pelosi shot back: “Don’t start with me.” In “Retribution,” Karl notes that with big-name Democrats, such as the Clintons, and potential challengers, like Pennsylvania Gov.

Getty Images AOC’s rant at Sunday night’s Mamdani rally was only a tad more unhinged than her usual, but she amplified a nasty leftist lie when she said that military aid to Israel is why there’s poverty in America. “We demand,” declared Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Queens-Bx.), “that we pay to care for our people instead of the flattening of Palestinians.” Zohran Mamdani says he finds it “hard” to explain to tenants of Queensbridge Houses why “they have to live in substandard conditions” while we spend “billions of dollars to drop bombs that kill tens of thousands of Palestinians.” The canard that Israel is skimming the cream from America to oppress Palestinians has become a popular trope among anti-Zionists and antisemites left and right; the gross insinuation is that, absent aid to Israel, all America’s social needs would be answered. Yes, under the US-Israeli security assistance Memorandum of Understanding, the Jewish state gets an annual $3.3 billion voucher to buy US-made military equipment. That’s not nothing, but it pales against the $1 trillion a year America now spends on defense, including $40 billion to $45 billion in support of Europe. And that doesn’t count the nearly $200 billion we’ve given Ukraine to frustrate Moscow’s European ambitions. More From Post Editorial Board Mamdani’s main victims, trans demands warp reality and other commentary Kathy Hochul’s pander to Zohran Mamdani and his socialists is beyond pathetic Shutdown puzzle: When will Democrats get back in touch with reality? Washington spends at least $12 billion a year in military support for Japan and Korea, where we station about 80,000 troops; those nations reimburse us for roughly a third of the cost of protecting them from North Korea, China and Russia. In 2024, Uncle Sam gave Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen and Sudan a total of about $4 billion. Those countries are human-rights disasters, with millions of refugees and hundreds of thousands of dead in their various wars. But you never hear AOC or her anti-Israel friends fret about their victims. Israel spends roughly $25 billion on defense every year; the aid it gets from America is not insignificant, but it’s hardly make-or-break for either side. We also benefit heavily from Israeli technology and intelligence sharing, from its position in a crucial and volatile region and from its service as a laboratory to field-test American weaponry. You can absolutely make the case that some US aid to other countries has been foolish. But the crowd pretending that Washington doesn’t get real value for its support of Jerusalem isn’t actually looking to benefit anyone here at home; these haters simply despise the Jewish state, and the Jews.

SIGN UP NOW Of course that is what everyone who cares about the Giants wants right now. The belief and adoration for the rookie quarterback is growing with each game, even if those games are losses, because of the way he plays, comports himself and puts on display a fun but no-nonsense demeanor that is going to eventually create an overwhelming desire to make sure no one lets him down. Do everything possible to help the kid out and, given the state of the wide receiver room, it sure would benefit this 22-year old if the front office were able to trade for someone who can get open and catch the ball when it is thrown his way. There are no season savers out there, and the bar would only be this: A definite upgrade from Lil’Jordan Humphrey, Beaux Collins and fading Jalin Hyatt. Someone who could slide in with Wan’Dale Robinson and Darius Slayton and give Dart and the passing attack at least a bit more firepower — especially now that there will be no more bruising, inspired play from rookie running back Cam Skattebo until 2026. This all sounds wonderful and is probably not going to happen. There are probably 10 teams out there either in or on the fringe of playoff contention that might be interested in taking the dive into the trade waters for another pass catcher. The Giants at 2-6 are not on the fringe of anything, and so bringing in a receiver would be all about helping Dart and not about saving this season.

James Messerschmidt ‘Mayor’ Sliwa’s nine lives I’m writing this at 2 a.m. Can’t sleep. The thought of Crapdammy running NYC makes me run to the john. Which then brings me to sleazy Sliwa whose mouth is the only thing that works. He never had a real job. Managed what? Invented what? Created what? Sold what? Organized what? Advertised what? Ran what? Disseminated what? Built what? Manufactured what? Earned income from what? Married more than once. Trouble paying child support. Home? He once ridiculed a millionaire mansion in Chappaqua. I can understand that because he’s lived in a one-room thing with 17 cats. What’s he done? Accomplished? Nothing. Nada. Zero. He’s just a talker. An open empty throat. His earnings came from WABC radio’s John and Margo Catsimatidis, who live in New York, work in New York, raised their family in New York, pay taxes in New York and whom Sleazy has since now insulted for suggesting that to save this election he take his red beret from his unproductive head and stick it up his pink behind. He’s in his 70s and done what? Roscoe the bedbug dog’s done more. He patrolled the subway. Good idea then. Also good for photos and p.r. about sleazy Sliwa which is all this egocentric failure wants.

REUTERS To have any hope of stopping the looming Zohran Mamdani catastrophe, New Yorkers need to get to the voting booth and cast their ballots against him. The situation couldn’t be more dire: Mamdani’s promises — free buses and child care, no rent hikes, etc. — and charm have won him a commanding lead in the polls. Fortunately, that edge is narrowing dramatically in final days: A Suffolk University survey finds he’s now just 10 points ahead of second-place contender Andrew Cuomo, down from a 20-point lead last month. Plus, the over-54 crowd — which polls suggest favors Cuomo — turned out big for early voting this past weekend, boosting his prospects further. Mamdani’s core strength — Democratic Socialist activists and the folks they can manage to bring in — was vital to his victory in the June primary, but is less of an advantage the higher overall turnout gets. More From Post Editorial Board Mamdani’s main victims, trans demands warp reality and other commentary Kathy Hochul’s pander to Zohran Mamdani and his socialists is beyond pathetic Shutdown puzzle: When will Democrats get back in touch with reality? If enough sensible New Yorkers cast their ballots, they can prevent a victory by the antisemitic socialist and head off disaster for Gotham. New Yorkers, it seems, are starting to wake up to the Mamdani threat. They know turning the city into a socialist haven would spell disaster. That the punitive tax hikes he’s envisioning would send the city’s tax base fleeing, triggering a major fiscal crisis. That businesses will skedaddle, taking jobs, tax revenue and economic activity with them. They know his rent freeze will destroy much of the city’s housing stock, leaving apartments in shabby shape and shutting many low-income tenants out of the market altogether. New Yorkers understand that his “free” buses (assuming he can find the money for them) will be packed to the gills, and/or turned into rolling homeless shelters — even as the subways are starved for riders and fare revenue. They fear a crime spike when Mamdani quietly defunds and cripples the NYPD. Minorities realize they’ll suffer most. Parents are keenly aware they’d have no one to hold accountable for lousy schools if Mamdani wins, since he’s openly vowed to ditch mayoral control, restoring a system run by the teachers union and geared to serve adult interests, not students. Nor do they want legalized prostitutes strutting down streets where their kids walk. Jews fear he’ll let his fellow antisemites run wild as they claim their “free-speech rights” to “globalize the intifada.” We understand why many of our readers prefer Curtis Sliwa, but a vote for him is not a vote to stop Mamdani: The grim fact is that, at this point, Cuomo is the only candidate who can. Yes, it’s encouraging to see Mamdani’s support finally collapsing, but it’ll still take every single vote for Cuomo to overcome that 10-point deficit. We know: It’s hard for many New Yorkers to get behind Cuomo, given his own disappointing record. But Mamdani is a virtually existential threat.

Scottsdale police are investigating the early-morning break-in at Mon Cheri, a rose-themed restaurant in the Old Town section of Scottsdale known for its pink décor and Instagram-ready displays. Owner Lexi Caliskan said the bizarre burglary began around 3:50 a.m. Saturday, when security footage showed a man and woman entering the property, engaging in sexual activity among the floral decorations near the outdoor patio seating area, then forcing their way inside. 4 A couple caught on security cameras having sex inside a Scottsdale restaurant allegedly capped off their steamy encounter by stealing cash, liquor and a phone, police said. “They got caught in the moment, there’s roses everywhere, maybe it was kind of romantic, but modern-day Bonnie and Clyde,” Caliskan told ABC15 Arizona.

Yes, we’re full of romance and happiness, but that’s not what we’re wanting here,” she said. Despite the unsettling incident, Caliskan reopened for business the same day, keeping her sense of humor about what she described as a surreal scene.

And hoping to deliver New Jersey from blue, flip it red and elect Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. Citizens Alliance initiative NJ Chase has mobilized 105 workers to knock on doors all over New Jersey since August 4. As of Monday morning, they’ve hit 408,835 doors and are projected to reach at least 500,000 by Election Day. 7 Republican candidate Jack Ciatarelli is in a tight race with Dem candidate Mikie Sherrill. Aristide Economopoulos The initiative is a spinoff of PA Chase which along with Scott Pressler’s Early Vote Action, helped methodically flip the Keystone state red for President Trump in 2024. Pressler has also seemingly been everywhere Ciattarelli is, rallying voters to come out for the GOP. “We’re in a very competitive spot,” Citizens Alliance CEO Cliff Maloney told of the neck-and-neck race between Ciattarelli and Dem candidate Mikie Sherrill. “It’s where we wanted to be.” More From Kirsten Fleming Even Bernie Sanders admits Mamdani won’t have all the answers if elected —and called on New Yorkers to assist him NYC politicians freaked out over the Canal Street raid — showing they care more about sticking it to Trump than protecting New Yorkers Andrew Cuomo finally lands punches against smug Zohran Mamdani in NYC’s last debate before the mayoral election A poll by co/efficient released Monday showed Sherrill with 48 percent of the potential vote compared to 47 percent for Ciattarelli, with five percent still undecided – making it too close for comfort for either candidate. 7 Cliff Maloney, Citizens Alliance CEO, has taken his door knocking formula that helped flip PA red to Jersey. @realCliffMaloney/Instagram Citizens Alliance targets registered Republicans, who are unlikely to vote, to request mail-in ballots and ensure they actually send them in before election day. They’re essentially the good kind of nags. “I did not create this strategy. I am just replicating what Joe Biden did in Pennsylvania in 2020… We’re running a reminder campaign. It’s placing a 20-year-old at their door and saying, ‘Will you promise and commit to voting today?’ We’re finally competing on the right.” Otherwise, there’s a significant amount of Republican votes wasted and left on the floor. 7 Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli giving a thumbs up at his “It’s Time” rally at the Saddle Brook Diner in New Jersey. Kyle Mazza – CNP/Shutterstock 7 A “Flip New Jersey Red” Jack Ciattarelli sign in Hawthorne, New Jersey. Christopher Sadowski In Pennsylvania in 2020, there were 140,000 Republicans who never sent their ballots back. “In 2024, we got that number [down] to 62,000,” said Maloney, adding that in Jersey, GOP voters had 183,908 mail requests. Currently only 83,000 are outstanding. “We’ve heard thousands and thousands of times [from residents] that our door knocker is the first person who has come to their homes in years, if not ever.” And every bit helps. In 2021, Ciattarelli came close to unseating Dem incumbent Phil Murphy, but fell just short by three percent. 7 Mikie Sherrill campaigns with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock When he lost, voters were fed up with COVID-19 mandates. But this cycle, they’re facing sky high energy bills, exorbitant taxes and woke agendas in schools. For most of Murphy’s second term, school boards tangled with the state to establish common sense parental notification guidelines for kids who had socially transitioned. The state’s position was that the schools had no responsibility to inform parents of trans kids. Just today, the Daily Wire reported the powerful New Jersey Education Association, which is backing Sherrill, will be hosting a panel for public school teachers, “Drag is not a Crime: The Past, Present, and Future of Drag” as part of their initiative to boost DEI in K12. I grew up in Ocean County and though I’ve lived in New York City for close to 25 years, I still spend a lot of time there and in Monmouth County. Most people I know shake their heads at this nonsense and have only moved to the political right since COVID. 7 NJ Chase organizers knocking on doors in New Jersey. Courtesy of Citizens Alliance It’s a trend we’re seeing in Jersey. During the last presidential election, Trump lost to Harris by only six points. In 2020, Biden won by the much larger margin of 16 points. Sherrill, a Virginia native who was elected to Congress in 2018, touts her experience as a former Navy helicopter pilot. Ironically, it feels like she just landed in NJ out of nowhere. In a state like Jersey — which thrives on personality — Sherrill seems like an empty vessel, lacking conviction or attitude. And she’s blown her early lead. “We’re trending in the right direction,” said NJ Chase spokesperson, Alex Zdan, “We’re trending toward becoming a swing state.” 7 New Jersey Chase staffers have knocked on more than 408,835 doors so far. Over the weekend, the GOP candidate earned some serious momentum when influential Orthodox Jewish groups united to endorse him. First the VAAD, a powerful council of Orthodox leaders in Lakewood, gave him the nod and then all the surrounding town councils joined in. It was reportedly an unprecedented consensus. In 2021, the VAAD endorsed Phil Murphy – though Ciattarelli won Lakewood. The Orthodox community, centered in Lakewood but has spread to all neighboring towns, skews conservative and has seen both their population and political power explode in recent years. This race is a bellwether for the 2026 midterms. And this surge for Ciattarelli is an encouraging sign for conservatives, especially as New York City prepares to elect a nepo baby socialist, running on a platform to tax the rich and make everything free. It’s heartening to know that at least my native state is moving toward pragmatism and common sense – and is perhaps a better indication of the national political climate. But this isn’t the election to sit on your tuchus. Get out and vote. Vote for Ciattarelli.

The facility, located at 188 West 230th St., will now house the Bronx District Attorney’s Office, Safe Horizon, Bronx Adult Special Victims Squad, and the Special Victims Major Case squad to promote collaboration, the NYPD announced. The NYPD unveiled a new $5.8 million Special Victims Unit facility in the Bronx on Monday, designed to boost investigations and offer support to survivors of sexual assault. TOMAS E. GASTON Safe Horizon, which offers survivors a slew of safety resources, does not have offices inside the Bronx SVU facility located in the 41st Precinct on Simpson Street. The old building earned the moniker “Fort Apache” due to the high crime rates in the area. The new state-of-the-art facility will have several trauma-informed spaces to prioritize the well-being of sexual assault survivors, including a lactating room, a stress reduction room, trauma-informed interview rooms, and a child-friendly area, authorities said.

That building carries a long history in the New York City police, but it was never designed for the deeply sensitive work that was done by our team,” First Deputy Commissioner Tania Kinsella said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony outside the new facility Monday. It’s unclear when the new facility will become fully operational, but Chief of Special Victims Carlos Ortiz expects it to be “soon.” TOMAS E. GASTON “Our Special Victims Detectives are the best in the world at what they do. But even the greatest investigators need the right tools and the right environment to deliver justice to survivors. This new facility ensures they will have exactly that,” Kinsella added. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the new SVU facility provides a “welcoming environment” for survivors of sexual assault. “It is a place designed to give survivors privacy and to bring everyone involved in these cases together in one setting. This is what 21st-century policing looks like – and what it means to build a survivor-focused NYPD,” the commissioner said in a statement. The NYPD’s Special Victims Unit is comprised of over 300 investigators tasked with investigating sexual violence cases. It’s unclear when the facility will become fully operational, but Chief of Special Victims Carlos Ortiz expects it to be “soon.” “This facility is a symbol of compassion. When victims who [have] recently been traumatized walk through these doors, they will find a calm and peaceful place that they can talk. And really be trauma-focused to understand what really happened to them,” said Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark. “We know what it was like over there at Simpson Street ….

Shania Twain has revealed whether she has “beef” with Brad Pitt for using his name in her 1997 hit “That Don’t Impress Me Much.” “We’ve never met,” Twain, 60, said during an appearance on Australia’s “Will \u0026 Woody” radio show Monday. “I mean, there’s a lot of Hollywood celebrities I’ve never met.” 10 Shania Twain performs during the 2025 Festival d’été de Québec in Quebec City, Quebec, on July 12, 2025.

Getty Images “OK, so you’re Brad Pitt?” she sang. “That don’t impress me much.” Nearly 28 years later, Twain explained why she included that line in “That Don’t Impress Me Much” while chatting on “Will \u0026 Woody.” “I was thinking, okay, everybody in the world is in love with Brad Pitt right now. There were nude photos of him, and everybody was gaga over that,” she recalled. “And I’m thinking, okay, if there is anyone that is making an impression on everyone…and that’s why I picked on him.” 10 Twain performing as the musical guest on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” on July 12, 1995.

GC Images “You’d think by now, he’s okay,” Twain added. “He certainly doesn’t have to try very hard. I’m sure he’s got a pretty good sense of humor.” The “You’re Still the One” singer previously discussed how Pitt’s name was chosen for her hit song during an interview with Spotify in 2017. “You want to know the truth about this story? I’ve never told this before. I’m going to say it now,” she shared for the first time. “I remember I had a girlfriend visiting me, and it was near Christmas, and we were baking cookies.” 10 Twain arrives for the People’s Choice Country Awards at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sept. 26, 2024.

A judge ultimately ordered the magazine not to deliver any more copies of that edition, per the outlet, but didn’t order the recall of magazines already sent to subscribers. 10 Pitt at Cineworld Leicester Square in London, England, on June 23, 2025.

We see people naked every day. That’s really what I thought.” “I wasn’t picking on Brad Pitt,” she clarified. “But that was just the association in that moment, and things we make a fuss about and whatever. Of course, it could have been any gorgeous guy.” As for Pitt, he later addressed the song lyric after Twain replaced his name with Ryan Reynolds’ during a performance at the 2022 People’s Choice Awards. 10 Twain at the Teatro Del Silenzio in Lajatico, Italy, on July 19, 2024.

The airline, based at Humberside Airport in North Lincolnshire, filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators on Monday — a move that gives it up to 10 days of protection from creditors while it explores rescue options or prepares for insolvency proceedings. The UK Civil Aviation Authority confirmed all Eastern Airways trips have been cancelled and urged passengers not to go to airports for their flights.

NurPhoto via Getty Images “We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Eastern Airways flights are cancelled,” said Selina Chadha, the CAA’s consumer and markets director. The regulator advised travelers to seek alternative transport, adding that rail companies including London North Eastern Railway, ScotRail, TransPennine Express and Northern Railway will offer free standard-class travel to affected passengers and staff on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Airport departure boards showed widespread cancellations Monday, including the 7 a.m. flight from Newquay to London Gatwick, the 2:30 p.m. service from Aberdeen to Wick, and the 6:15 p.m. flight from Teesside to Aberdeen. Scottish airline Loganair said it would offer stranded passengers discounted airfares on flights between Aberdeen and Kirkwall or Sumburgh through Oct. 30. Passengers who booked directly with Eastern are advised to contact their credit or debit card issuers to seek chargebacks for cancelled flights, the CAA said.

Getty Images Eastern Airways, founded in 1997, operated regional routes across the UK, Ireland and Europe. It also ran subsidized services backed by the Scottish government connecting Aberdeen with Wick John O’Groats — a lifeline route for residents in the northernmost part of mainland Britain. The carrier’s network included flights from East Midlands, Jersey, Manchester, Newcastle, Newquay and Southampton, as well as Esbjerg in Denmark. It was also active in the North Sea oil and gas industry, ferrying workers between energy hubs such as Aberdeen, Humberside and Teesside. Like other regional airlines, Eastern has struggled financially since the COVID-19 pandemic, hit by lower passenger demand and rising fuel and maintenance costs.

Now, they need to figure out if their offense can actually be saved. Take flight with the Jets Text with Brian Costello all season as he brings Sports+ subscribers the latest Jets intel from on the field and off. tRY IT NOW The Jets rolled up 502 total yards, their most since a game in 2021. They gained 254 yards rushing, again the most since a game in 2021. Quarterback Justin Fields played his best game of the season, throwing the ball effectively and mixing in some runs. Breece Hall had two rushing touchdowns, 133 rushing yards and threw the game-winning touchdown pass. Everything that offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand dialed up seemed to work in the 39-38 comeback win over the Bengals. “I thought Tanner did a really good job of really managing the game and putting our guys in positions to be successful,” Jets coach Aaron Glenn said Monday. “We were very aggressive when it came to running the ball and just showing our brand of football when it comes to running the ball and being physical, and then also being aggressive of pushing the ball down the field with Justin, so he can go out and make the plays he needs to make. And I thought Justin did a hell of a job of managing the game.” 4 Jets offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand speaks with the media before practice in Florham Park, NJ. Bill Kostroun/New York Post The offensive explosion was stunning considering the Jets had not even scored a touchdown in their last two games. They were only two weeks removed from a performance in London when they had minus-10 net passing yards against the Broncos and a week removed from Glenn benching Fields at halftime. Explore More NFL Power Rankings for Week 9: Where things stand after a bunch of blowouts Aaron Glenn won’t have this Jets luxury coming off of first win The Breece Hall mistake Jets need to avoid at NFL trade deadline The question now is whether the Jets actually figured out some things on offense or if it was more a product of facing a Bengals defense that is ranked last in the NFL in yards and points allowed. “The next step is finding way to churn out offense like that week in, week out,” center Josh Myers said. “That’s what we’re going to get back and start working on.” There were many stars on offense for the Jets in this game, but the day’s gutsiest performance came from Fields, who was under fire all week. Fields had been benched at halftime against the Panthers and then had to compete for the starting job with Tyrod Taylor. Jets owner Woody Johnson offered some harsh criticism of Fields and the quarterback admitted after the game it had been an emotional week for him. 4 Justin Fields #7 and Azareye’h Thomas #23 of the New York Jets speak to the media after the game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paycor Stadium on October 26, 2025 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

AP The offensive line gave Fields time to operate and he moved the Jets offense efficiently and led three fourth-quarter touchdown drives. “Back against the wall and that’s what you do? That’s somebody that I want to play with,” defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said. “There’s a reason there’s a ‘C’ on his chest.” Glenn had plenty of praise for Fields, but would not commit to him being the starter on Nov. 9, when the Jets face the Browns after their bye week. CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND JETS STATS “I think you know what my answer’s going to be on that,” Glenn said. “You know, this is a bye week and we’re going to focus on us. And, listen, I have time to make that decision, and that’s one of the good things of the bye week. But seriously, this gives us a chance to really just hone in on the good, bad, and ugly, and try to get those things worked out because we know we have a ways to go.” Glenn thought Fields showed his toughness on Sunday. “His personality, his faith, his family, man they do a really good job of keeping him grounded and keeping him steady,” Glenn said. “There are so many levels to things that he goes through as a person and as a player that. I think sometimes we look at athletes at this magnitude of they’re not humans, they’re robots, and there’s so many things that’s attacked at so many different levels on these guys that, man they’re humans and they have feelings.

John Kennedy, Bay Shore High School’s art teacher, was pulled from the classroom and placed on administrative leave Wednesday after the district was made aware of alleged text messages he exchanged with a female student — which sources claimed contained explicit, sexual language — prompting a probe by Suffolk County police. 4 John Kennedy, a Long Island high school art teacher, is accused of allegedly sending explicit texts to a female student. Bay Shore Schools District and police sources confirmed the allegations and told The Post that Kennedy, 48, was the teacher placed on leave, while Suffolk PD would only comment that there is an active investigation into a Bay Shore teacher. “The Bay Shore School District has been made aware of allegations involving a High School staff member,” Superintendent Steven Maloney said in a Wednesday statement. “When made aware, the District took immediate action, placing the staff member on administrative leave and barring the individual from District property. 4 Bay Shore High School Google Maps Explore More Young woman\u0027s naked body found stuffed in green duffel bag, dumped on NYC sidewalk Mamdani didn’t tell the whole truth about his hijab-wearing \u0027aunt\u0027 who feared for safety post-9/11 Charlie Kirk suspect\u0027s trans lover goes missing 6 weeks after political assassination “The Suffolk County Police Department was immediately notified and we continue to fully cooperate with their ongoing investigation.” The school district and Suffolk police have not officially named Kennedy and have remained otherwise tight-lipped about the case. The student, believed to be a senior at the high school, had been carrying on a relationship with Kennedy since at least the summer, according to a source. Another source called the alleged text messages “disgusting.” Although the full nature of the communications and the identity of the student remain a mystery, teachers and students alike were shocked to learn of the accusations — against someone who many described as their “favorite teacher.” “It’s sad, everyone liked him, especially the kids, he was beloved,” said a teacher in the district, who confirmed that Kennedy was the teacher placed on leave. One student, who was in Kennedy’s art class this year, said he’s still trying to process the betrayal from a person he trusted. 4 Thomas Bernagozzi, a Long Island teacher accused of sexually abusing more than 50 former students. Suffolk County Police Department “He was a great teacher — but stuff happened and now I’m looking at him very differently,” said the 11th grade student, who asked to remain anonymous. The scandal marks the third high-profile incident involving possible sexual misconduct by Bay Shore teachers. In November 2024, the district was ordered to pay $25 million in damages tied to a decades-old abuse case involving retired third-grade teacher Thomas Bernagozzi, who was accused of sexually abusing students for more than three decades while working at multiple elementary schools. A Suffolk County jury found that the district ignored repeated warning signs about Bernagozzi, now 76, whose alleged abuse spanned the 1970s through the early 2000s — over 50 former students have since come forward. 4 Marcus Johnson was charged with raping a 15-year-old while employed as a teacher’s assistant Bay Shore High School in 2017. New York Post Marcus Johnson, a teacher’s assistant at the high school, was charged with raping a 15-year-old student in 2017. The allegations against Kennedy also come just two weeks after another Long Island educator at an elementary school in the Shoreham-Wading River district, Mark Verity, was arrested in a sting where he admitted on-camera to sexting with who he thought was a 13-year-old girl.

Sōrate grew out of an online matcha subscription service Mella launched in 2020. 8 Sorate’s founders Silvia Mella and Nicola Zanatta. Sorate/Riccardo Piazza Photography Nicola Zanatta, who worked for Möet Hennessy for 15 years, joined as a partner in 2023 to launch the duo’s first brick-and-mortar store in Soho, at 103 Sullivan St. The new outpost, at 30 E. 18th St., is a sleek 600-square-foot space featuring dark walls and elegant wood inside. Participating in a tea ceremony costs $120. Tea tastings are $60 in Flatiron, where they come with snacks, or $90 with light bites in Soho. “The tea ceremony symbolizes harmony, respect, purity and tranquility — in a simple bowl of tea,” said tea master Keiko Kitazawa, citing the four principles that are known in Japanese as “wa,” “kei,” “sei” and “jaku.” 8 The goal is to make customers in the city that never sleeps feel a sense of meditative stillness, according to Mella, whose shop recently opened in spite of an international matcha shortage and US tariffs on Japan. Sorate/Riccardo Piazza Photography “People are so busy, but when they come to the tea ceremony, they can have their moment to relax and enjoy,” said Kitazawa, who was sporting a colorful kimono. To go with the tea, the shop offers small, sweet Japanese treats known as wagashi. They include seasonal chestnut and pumpkin flavors made with sweet bean paste to counter matcha’s slightly bitter taste. Matcha, a finely powdered green tea that is stirred with a bamboo whisk and hot water until smooth and frothy, is offered hot or iced. The shop will add milk upon request — no judgement, though the vibrant green drink served for thousands of years in Japan and China is meant to be served in its purest form, said Mella, who previously worked in fashion advertising and marketing. 8 Matcha, a finely powdered green tea that is stirred with a bamboo whisk and hot water until smooth and frothy, is offered hot or iced. Sorate/Riccardo Piazza Photography Japan now exports more than half its matcha. Retail sales of it grew 86% over the past three years, according to research firm NIQ. This year was rough since Japan had a reduced harvest because of poor weather. That, plus higher demand and increased tourism to Japan, led to price hikes for ceremonial-grade matcha, according to Mella. On top of that, US imports from Japan face a 15% tariff. Sōrate’s house matcha, which last year sold for $29 for 40 grams, is now $40, while the highest grade matcha increased from $62 to $110 for 40 grams, Mella said. Shoppers in Japan are currently limited to just one package per person, according to reports. Even in the best of times, matcha can be fickle. 8 Japan now exports more than half its matcha. Retail sales of it grew 86% over the past three years, according to research firm NIQ. Sorate/Riccardo Piazza Photography “High-quality matcha is hand picked and it’s seasonal,” said Kitazawa. “There’s a limited time to pick the leaves and to powder the matcha. It takes one hour for just 30 grams, and each person needs two to three grams of matcha per serving.” Kitazawa explained ceremonial-grade matcha is sold in small batches based on relationships “between the tea houses and the tea ceremony practitioners.” To keep up with demand, Mella said Sōrate had to expand its network and find new partner farms in Japan. 8 The new outpost, at 30 E. 18th St., is a sleek 600-square-foot space featuring dark walls and elegant wood inside.

Kirill Dmitriev, the Kremlin-linked financier who once served as Moscow’s backchannel to Washington, spent the weekend trying to schmooze top Trump officials and going on a media blitz. But the move failed spectacularly, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bluntly blasting Dmitriev as a “Russian propagandist,” and NATO Amb. Matt Whitaker flatly rejected his overtures — saying the administration’s energy crackdown would continue. 3 Russian financier Kirill Dmitriev held meetings with US officials after the Trump administration issued new sanction on Russian oil. POOL/AFP via Getty Images On one of the country’s biggest Sunday morning news shows, Bessent mocked Dmitriev’s latest assertion that the sanctions would have “absolutely no effect on Russia’s economy” and “will only lead to gasoline costing more at American gas stations.” “I think Russia is going to feel the pain immediately … And Margaret, are you really going to publish what a Russian propagandist says?” Bessent said on “Face the Nation” with Margaret Brennan, chiding the host for bringing up Dimitriev’s claims.

That, ‘oh, it’s going to be terrible, and it’s going to bring Putin to the table’? “The Russian economy is a wartime economy. Growth is virtually zero. Inflation, I believe, is over 20% and everything we do is going to bring Putin to the table. It’s oil that funds the Russian war machine, and I think we can make a substantial dent in his profits.” The markets support Bessent’s assessment, with Lukoil and Rosneft, the two oil companies losing $11.5 billion in combined market value since Trump levied the sanctions, according to the Moscow Times. 3 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed Dmitriev as a Russian propagandist. REUTERS The trend continued on Monday, with Rosneft shares falling roughly 5.6% to 368.4 rubles — the lowest since March 2023, according to the report. Lukoil similarly dropped 6.5%, following a whopping 12.2% plunge last week. Whitaker, meanwhile, said Putin’s decision to send Dmitriev for the whirlwind weekend visit further proved that “President Trump holds all the cards” on Fox News’ The Sunday Briefing.

It’s not going to get better for them, and President Trump’s going to continue to play these cards, like these significant oil sanctions,” he said. “… Every single turn the Russians are not showing from a position of strength. They’re actually they look very weak right now.” “… They should end this war in the killing. They’re not gaining any territory for the thousands of troops that they’re losing every single week on the battlefields in Ukraine.” 3 Bessent said the sanctions are an attempt to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to “come to the table” and negotiate the end of the Ukraine war. REUTERS Analysts with whom The Post spoke on Monday said Putin’s decision to rush Dmitriev to the US following the sanctions indicated that the Kremlin is squirming from the economic pressure. “It’s a sign that the White House is developing strategic clarity that Moscow is not willing to negotiate anything beyond the terms of American concessions and Ukraine surrender, and that the admin shouldn’t allow the Russians to continue wasting President Trump’s time by dragging out the process,” Institute of the Study of War’s Russia team lead George Barros told The Post. While Dmitriev held some meetings with US officials — including Rep. Anna Paulina Lune (R-Fla.) and Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff — Foundation for Defending Democracy’s Russia program director John Hardie said Dmitriev largely stuck his foot in his mouth, and did not seem successful in attempts to persuade Washington from letting up the pressure until action steps toward peace are taken. “I don’t know what he and Witkoff discussed, but I doubt the visit will yield much for Moscow,” he said. “And frankly, Dmitriev’s messaging and some of the meetings he took just come across as pathetic and tone deaf.

New Jersey Election Law Commission officials unanimously determined Monday that Ciattarelli can sue Sherrill (D-NJ) without flouting state campaign finance laws. “Mr. Ciattarelli  believes that he was defamed during the gubernatorial debate. He seeks to pursue that claim for defamation against Mikie Sherrill,” Ciattarelli’s campaign attorney, Mark Sheridan said during a Monday hearing, Gothamist reported. “He does not intend to use any campaign funds or any matching funds. It’s solely his own funds.” During Ciattarelli’s debate against Sherrill on Oct. 8, the congresswoman lobbed a seemingly practiced attack against his business endeavors. 3 The two New Jersey gubernatorial contenders squared off in a debate earlier this month.

And as if that wasn’t enough, then he was paid to develop an app so that people who were addicted could more easily get access to opioids,” she said. Sherrill has repeatedly doubled down on those stunning attacks. Recently, she bashed him as “a total baby” for his threats to sue her. Her campaign shrugged off the New Jersey Election Law Commission vote, allowing Ciattarelli’s defamation suit to move forward. 3 Republican Jack Ciattarelli blasted Mikie Sherrill’s accusations about his role in the opioid pandemic. Leonardo Munoz “The moment Mikie Sherrill pressed him on the truth about his business, which peddled deadly misinformation about opioids,” Sherrill campaign communications director Sean Higgins hit back. “He threatened to file a lawsuit to shut the conversation down. “Jack has yet to deny his role in fueling the opioid epidemic, and if he actually follows through on his desperate and frivolous lawsuit, we look forward to obtaining legal discovery into Jack putting millions in profits over those dying in the opioid crisis.” The issue emerged during the 2021 gubernatorial cycle and revolved around Ciattarelli’s since-defunct Somerville-based Galen Publishing, which made $12.2 million between 2007 and 2016 on a contract for continuing education materials with the University of Tennessee’s pharmacy school. Galen Publishing was one of two medical publishing companies that Ciattarelli co-founded alongside American Medical Publishing. The firm produced material on pain management that critics say minimized the potential dangers of opioid use. “Misuse or diversion of pain relievers is a significant problem, especially among adolescents and young adults. Concerns about opioid dependence, addiction, or non-medical use often create barriers to effective pain management,” one of the papers said, NJ.com reported in 2021. 3 Rep. Mikie Sherrill called Jack Ciattarelli a “baby” for planning to sue her. Getty Images “The risk of opioid misuse is low among patients with chronic pain who do not have preexisting substance use disorders.” That material was published as part of a deal with the University of Tennessee was underwritten in part by key players in the pharmaceutical industry. Ciattarelli later sold Galen Publishing for over $12 million in 2017. The Post reached out to the Ciattarelli campaign for comment.

It’s not often a celebrity airs their dirtiest laundry in public. But singer Lily Allen shocked everyone last Friday with her new album “West End Girl,” which appears to present everything you ever wanted to know — and much, much more — about why her marriage to “Stranger Things” star David Harbour went off the rails. “I found a shoebox full of handwritten letters from brokenhearted women,” she sings on “Pu–y Palace,” a song about visiting a partner’s secret hook-up apartment. “Sheets pulled off the bed … Long black hair, probably from the night before/ Duane Reade bag with the handles tied/ Sex toys … lube inside/ Hundreds of Trojans … How’d I get caught up in your double life?” 11 Lily Allen sings about cheating, sex toys and open marriage on her new album — and has said that her relationship with David Harbour was an inspiration even as she said it mixes fact and fiction. Social media went crazy over the weekend, with cyber sleuths picking apart the lyrics and Gwyneth Paltrow calling the record a “masterpiece.” Page Six has reached out to Harbour for comment. He has not yet publicly spoken about the record, which is earning “The Fear” singer the best reviews she’s received in years.

They announced their split in February of this year. 11 Allen posted a photo of the card Harbour sent her for her 2021 West End debut in the play, “2:22 A Ghost Story.” Allen, 40, has been careful over the past few days, saying the lyrics are a “mixture of fact and fiction.” She and Harbour, 50, met on the dating app Raya wed in 2020 and confirmed their split last February — two years after showing off their Cobble Hill home in a much-shared Architectural Digest story and video. That home has just gone up for sale for nearly $8 million. Allen starts off the album singing about the fairy tale of setting up home in a Brooklyn brownstone “I could never afford.” In the title song, things start to sour when she lands a role in a play on London’s West End. 11 The singer is mom to daughters Ethel and Marnie. 11 Harbour remains close to his stepdaughters despite his wife’s tell-all album and took them to Universal Studios in Orlando this past weekend. In August 2021, Allen played Jenny in “2: 22: A Ghost Story.” The song gives a one-sided conversation in which she seems to be told her partner wants an open marriage while she is away — and she reluctantly goes along with it because “I want you to be happy.” In real life, Allen posted on social media a photo of the message Harbour sent with flowers for her debut. “My ambitious wife, these are bad luck flowers, ’cause if you get reviewed well in this play you will get all kinds of awards and I’ll be miserable, your loving husband,” he wrote. 11 Reports named costume assistant Natalie Tippet as the real-life other woman, “Madeline,” that Allen sings about. Allen told The Sunday Times this week: “There are usually agreed-upon boundaries in relationships. But whether those boundaries are adhered to or not is becoming a grey area all of a sudden. Dating apps make people disposable … there’s so much more to choose from — right in your pocket.” On the song “Madeline,” Allen sings, “We had an arrangement/ Be discreet and don’t be blatant/ There had to be payment/ It had to be with strangers.” She then details how that agreement was broken when the partner in the song got involved with a woman who wasn’t a stranger — and sings on the song “Tennis” of finding a text exchange with that woman on her partner’s phone. 11 The Brooklyn brownstone Harbour and Allen shared went on the market for nearly $8 million Monday. 11 The Cobble Hill home was featured in Architectural Digest. The Daily Mail has named the real-life “Madeline” as Natalie Tippett, a costume designer from New Orleans who reportedly met Harbour in 2021 on the set of the Netflix movie “We Have A Ghost.” Tippett told The Mail: “Of course I’ve heard the song. But I have a family and things to protect. I have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and I understand this is going on. It’s a little bit scary for me.” When asked if she had known Allen was going to mention her text messages, Tippett replied, “Yeah, I just don’t feel comfortable talking about it at the moment.” 11 Allen (right) was celebrated by London fashionista Katie Grand at the “West End Girl” album launch in London. Allen, meanwhile, has insisted that “Madeline” is a fictional character who is a “construct of others.” “There are things that are on the record that I experienced within my marriage, but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel,” she told the Sunday Times. It’s not the first time the British singer has opened up about her life, having written about — both in songs and her 2018 memoir — her broken first marriage to property developer Sam Cooper, with whom she shares daughters Ethel, 13, and Marnie, 12; the heartbreaking stillbirth of her son in 2010; and her struggles with addiction and an eating disorder. 11 Allen was supported by her childhood best pal and “Miss Me?” podcast co-host, DJ Miquita Oliver, at the launch. Her split with Harbour led Allen to fear she would relapse. “It got really, really, really bad,” she told Vogue.. “The feelings of despair that I was experiencing were so strong. The last time that I felt anything like that, drugs and alcohol were my way out, so it was excruciating to sit with those [feelings] and not use them.” She put herself into a residential facility after feeling, “That I wanted to die.” In April, GQ asked Harbour about rumors he or Allen had strayed in the marriage. “There’s no use in that form of engaging [with tabloid news] because it’s all based on hysterical hyperbole,” he said at the time. 11 Gwyneth Paltrow has called Allen’s “West End Girl” a “masterpiece.” The cover was created by illustrator Nieves González. Allen recorded the new album in just 16 days and is now getting the kind of acclaim she hasn’t seen since the early days of her career after debuting with 2006’s “Alright Still. “She felt that Universal [her old music label] didn’t treat her well,” the insider said. “But the love for this album is f—ing insane.” The singer has not yet finalized a divorce from Harbour, although she refers to him in interviews as her ex-husband. Asked about the tell-all album, she told Perfect magazine: “If what you’re doing isn’t provocative, what’s the f—ing point? And if it’s not scary, what’s the point? I’m not here to be mediocre.” Filed under celebrity couples celebrity divorces david harbour lily allen stranger things 10/27/25 Read Next Kim Cattrall details life after ‘SATC’ out of the coun...

Kelly said he respects Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, who he has known for 40 years through the Guardian Angels. “But it’s common sense now: You have to vote for Andrew Cuomo to have any shot, any chance to defeat [Zohran] Mamdani,” Kelly said on 77 WABC “Sid \u0026 Friends” show. 3 Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been endorsed for mayor by former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. Matthew McDermott Mamdani, the lefty Democratic nominee and front-runner, will “wreak havoc on us,” Kelly told host Sid Rosenberg. “It doesn’t look good, but we have to be on the smart side at this time,” said Kelly, who served two stints as police commissioner under Mayors Mike Bloomberg and David Dinkins.

The city’s former top cop called Mamdani’s initiative — to have social service workers approach individuals with mental illness without cops — “pie in the sky. 3 Kelly said his endorsement of Cuomo is about defeating Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani. AP “These events can turn on a dime and become very dangerous,” Kelly said. Mamdani has tried to make nice with the department and its supporters while running for mayor, distancing himself from comments he made in 2020 when he called the NYPD “racist, anti-queer \u0026 a major threat to public safety” and backed “defund the police.” With City Hall within his grasp, he now says he would retain Jessica Tisch as police commissioner. But Kelly said it would be “very difficult” for Tisch to work under Mamdani, given their disagreements on key criminal-justice issues. 3 Kelly claimed on WABC that Mamdani would “wreak havoc on us” if elected mayor. James Messerschmidt Cuomo welcomed Kelly’s endorsement. “Ray Kelly is one of the best police commissioners in the city’s history, and we appreciate his support as Andrew Cuomo fights for the vote of all uniformed members,” said Cuomo campaign spokesman Rich Azzopardi. See Also NYPD cops will flee the force if Mamdani is elected, Ray Kelly warns Cuomo has vowed to hire 5,000 more cops and keep the jail complex on Rikers Island running instead of opening new ones in the boroughs. Meanwhile, many of the city’s law-enforcement unions — rolled into the Uniformed Forces Coalition 2025 covering most of the city police, corrections and sanitation unions that backed Mayor Eric Adams’ re-election run before he dropped out of the race — have not endorsed Mamdani, Cuomo or Sliwa. The city Police Benevolent Association, representing beat cops but not part of the coalition, also has not endorsed a candidate. Reps from the law-enforcement higher-ups’ coalition– which includes the Detectives’ Endowment Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, Lieutenants Benevolent Association and Captains Endowment Association — met with Cuomo and Sliwa on Friday and decided not to endorse either candidate, a source familiar with the deliberations said. Nearly all the unions representing law enforcement and uniformed officers had backed Adams’ successful run for mayor in 2021, and some supported Republican Nicole Malliotakis for mayor in 2017, though none voiced their official support for Bill de Blasio when he first won the mayoralty in 2013. Cuomo’s actions as governor have come back to haunt him. He approved the state’s controversial cashless bail law, and police unions have blasted Cuomo’s state Parole Board appointees for releasing convicted cop-killers, a law-enforcement union source said. Reps for the coalitions did not meet with Mamdani’s campaign, but some of the union officials will continue to attack him as anti-cop, a labor insider said.

Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Burberry As for her career, Cattrall admitted that she now spends more time focusing on herself rather than any one particular role. “I think it defines me less,” she explained. “Kim has taken over, and not the characters she’s played, in a very definite way. The last 10 years have been more about exploring me, not connected to my work, but my own choices.” Cattrall starred in “Sex and the City” alongside Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie Bradshaw), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda Hobbes) and Kristin Davis (Charlotte York) from its premiere in 1998 to its finale in 2004. 12 Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Cattrall in a promo for “Sex and the City.” Getty Images 12 Willie Garson, Parker, Davis, Cattrall and Nixon during Season 3 of “Sex and the City.” Getty Images 12 Nixon, Parker, Cattrall and Davis in “Sex and the City 2” (2010). ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection Although she returned to star in both “Sex and the City” films in 2008 and 2010, Cattrall did not reprise her role in the recently ended “And Just Like That” except for a brief cameo during the spinoff’s Season 2 finale. “I remember in particular, doing that series, people wanted to speak to the character as opposed to me because she was fascinating, wonderful, smart and intelligent, and sexy and irreverent and all of those wonderful things that we could be,” Cattrall said of her role as the sex-positive public relations boss Samantha Jones. 12 Cattrall as Samantha Jones during Season 3 of “Sex and the City.” Getty Images 12 Cattrall as Samantha Jones in “Sex and the City” (2008). ©New Line Cinema/courtesy Everett / Everett Collection 12 Cattrall as Samantha Jones in “Sex and the City 2” (2010). ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection “But she wasn’t me,” Cattrall added. Meanwhile, the “Mannequin” star is still acting after the “Sex and the City” franchise has ended – even if she does have a few conditions before signing on for new projects. “It’s all about the writing. I don’t want to be on a set and realize that the character I’m playing is a character that I’ve already played many, many times before,” Cattrall explained. 12 Cattrall at the Dover in London, England, on Sept. 15, 2025.

Bartels, Jr., the business manager of Steamfitters Local 638 New York, said in a statement. “We need both parties to get back to work to ensure that government works for working people,” he added. 3 Bartels’ call for lawmakers to reopen the government comes as a the largest labor union for federal workers has also endorsed a clean continuing resolution. AFP via Getty Images Steamfitters Local 638 has about 10,000 active and retired members throughout New York City and Long Island. The union endorsed President Trump in the 2024 election. “For too long now, Government shutdowns have become a normal part of the bargaining process in Washington DC,” Bartels said.

A House-passed stopgap funding measure that funds the government at current levels through Nov. 21 – a so-called clean continuing resolution – has been voted down 12 times by all but three Senate Democrats since the shutdown started, on Oct. 1. Democratic leaders have instead demanded that Republicans make concessions on healthcare policy in exchange for reopening the government, but Trump and GOP leaders have refused to negotiate. “The Democrat shutdown has generated economic uncertainty for our critical industries and unnecessary suffering for American families,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told The Post. “The call to action is clear,” Rogers said of the Steamfitters’ statement. “Democrats must reopen the government through the passage of the clean continuing resolution.” 3 Federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, after all but three Democratic senators rejected a GOP bill to keep the government open. REUTERS 3 Schumer has refused to vote in favor of a GOP-backed measure to reopen the government at pre-shutdown spending levels. REUTERS Earlier Monday, the largest union of federal workers similarly demanded that senators move forward with the clean continuing resolution – after 1.4 million government employees missed their first full paychecks last week. “Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,” Kelley added. “No half measures, and no gamesmanship.” A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.

A new pop-up is raising a big stink, celebrating the city’s signature grime with a cheeky collection of rat-themed merch and chaotic charm, including a sold-out Ratbubu — a tattooed and pierced Labubu dressed like a rodent. The WELOVENYC “Comeback Collection” — featuring everything from creepy Ratbubu plushies to trash-bag earbud covers ($25), “Legal Cocaine” coffee mugs ($35) and “S–t Shield” sneaker guards ($12) — has true New Yorkers embracing the grit and grime of our beloved dirty city. “It’s more about what New York is really like. The funky stuff,” Tanya De Poli, a co-creator of WELOVENYC collection, told The Post about the curious compilation, a collaboration between numerous New York artists, which drew a long line of locals to the dingy corner of Walker and Lafayette for its Friday night opening. 10 The Ratbubu riffs on the mega-popular Labubu, giving it a truly NYC twist.

Shoppers were greeted in the teeny space at 101 Lafayette St. by a back wall covered in real rat traps spray-painted with “We Heart NYC,” where some of the creepy but cute $55 Ratbubus — the store’s priciest item — hung. The first 300 limited-edition toys sold out on opening night, sending desperate fans back to the store Saturday morning or sliding into the team’s DMs begging for one. “They went crazy,” De Poli told The Post with a laugh as a fresh shipment arrived on Monday afternoon. 10 The WELOVENYC “Comeback Collection” features the new creature in a setting befitting it.

Stefano Giovannini for N.Y.Post Labubus — small, plush toy keychains of an elf-like monster adorned with pointed ears, a wide serrated grin, large eyes, and fuzzy costumes — have gained popularity after being sported on the designer bags of celebrities like Rihanna, Dua Lipa, BLACKPINK’s Lisa, David Beckham, Emma Roberts, Hillary Duff, Kim Kardashian and countless others. Some have sold for as high as $10,000. But the new, coveted Ratbubus are much cheaper — at least for now. 10 What’s more New York than a Labubu-esque creature that celebrates the city’s rat population?

WELOVENYC Opening night also offered free, pre-designed “flash” tattoos by Chris Torres with any $50 purchase; the team was stunned by how many people waited patiently to have a rat permanently inked on their skin. However, don’t worry if you have FOMO: Ratbubus and more rat tats return Tuesday night — this time with rat-shaped latte art by Moonface. Keep in mind, though, that only 100 Ratbubus will be available, so you’d better hurry. Then the third and final Ratbubu drop happens Thursday, capped off with a rat costume contest so fans can twin with their new furry accessories. 10 Local artist Jay Mac created this window display, which includes a coveted Ratbubu.

One of my favourite aspects of this is the New York creatives involved who came together to make this happen,” Rick McGuire, the founder and creator behind SubwayCreatures, told Little Black Book. He partnered with the WELOVENYC team to curate the pop-up, which will run through Saturday, Nov. 1. View this post on Instagram A post shared by New York Post Lifestyle (@nypostlifestyle) Among the artists popping up is Pamela Barsky, known as the “Original New York Bag Lady” for her line of scrawled-on totes.

WELOVENYC “It’s the new and more honest New York,” WELOVENYC co-creator Checha Agost Carreno proclaimed to The Post, celebrating the authenticity of the project — which has an appreciative, clearly homegrown audience. “We didn’t want this collection to be for the tourists,” De Poli added.

James Messerschmidt A political operative later quipped to The Post, “It’s hard to fix something when you don’t even know what tools are in your toolbox.” Mamdani’s latest light-weight response to a crucial question on the minds of tens of thousands of New Yorkers is a trend for the lefty front-runner, who has been noticeably mum on other pivotal housing issues including proposals on the upcoming ballot.

James Messerschmidt “From the start of his proposal for a rent freeze, he clearly did not understand the role of the Rent Guidelines Board,” said Jay Martin, the executive vice president of the New York Apartment Association.

This is the pros, buddy,” Cunningham said, comparing Mamdani’s weak tactic to trying to run out the clock starting in the third quarter of a football game. “You can try to run the clock out, but two weeks of running the clock out is a lot of clock — let me tell you. 3 Mamdani at a campaign rally with Gov.

Every franchise does extra for its best player, and nobody — sans maybe Nikola Jokic — is as cut-and-dried the team’s top star as Antetokounmpo.

Week 8 of the NFL season featured an action-packed slate full of blowouts and dominant performances. Last week, the call on Patriots -7 against the Browns proved true. Drake Maye’s impressive quarterback play continued, and Mike Vrabel’s group outscored Cleveland by 17 points in the second half en route to a 32-13 victory. However, a few optimistic injury updates on Lamar Jackson fooled us and apparently other bettors into backing a shootout for the Ravens-Bears contest. Baltimore still emerged with the win, 30-16, but the point total did not cover an original line of 49.5. Rest assured, today is a new day. Buckle up, folks — we get to do it again.

The Panthers defense also allowed running back James Cook to have a career-best 216 yards rushing, along with two touchdowns. If Young’s ankle injury keeps him sidelined, I foresee this line of 12.5 going higher. The Bills convincingly defeated Carolina 40-9 last week, and it’s clear Young covers a lot of issues in Dave Canales’ offense. The Panthers do hold a respectable 4-4 record, but I don’t trust Dalton, especially with Parsons seemingly growing more comfortable with this Packers defense. Betting on the NFL?

Now the 49ers come into town and will try their hand against rookie sensation Jaxson Dart. The Ole Miss product is 2-0 at home as a starter, with huge upset wins over the Chargers and aforementioned Eagles. Dart plays with a certain confidence at MetLife, posting a rushing line of 24 carries, 115 yards, and 2 TDs. More importantly, he’s yet to turn the ball over at home. Giants QB Jaxson Dart is 2-0 at MetLife Stadium as a starter. Brad Penner-Imagn Images The 49ers’ roster has been decimated by the injury bug, with All-Pros Fred Warner and Nick Bosa on injured reserve. Their pass rush was absent last week against Houston, allowing CJ Stroud to throw a season-high 318 passing yards. Offensively, quarterback Brock Purdy has only played in two games, and pass catchers Brandon Aiyuk and Ricky Pearsall remain sidelined. George Kittle missed nearly a month before returning in Week 7. Although Purdy’s status to play is not yet determined, if Mac Jones is under center, I have confidence the Giants can cover +2 and even on the moneyline. After a 3-0 start, Jones has lost two of three games as starter. The Giants’ defensive front of Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence, Keyvon Thibodeaux and Abdul Carter is poised for a breakout opposite a suspect 49ers offensive line.

Mikie Sherrill with just over a week out from Election Day. Of the roughly 635,000 mail-in ballots and in-person early votes in New Jersey, 57% were registered Democrats, 26% were Republicans, and 17% had another party affiliation, according to the latest data compiled by Michael Pruser, DecisionDeskHQ’s director of Data Science. That’s a better outlook than Republican Jack Ciattarelli had at the end of early voting in 2021, when 58% of mail-in ballots and in-person early votes were Democrats, 22% Republicans, and 20% had another affiliation. But the GOP still has a roughly 202,000 raw vote gap with Democrats, and initial in-person voting trends are only worsening Republicans’ margin. “We’re starting to see a narrowing of the viable paths available to Republicans,” Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for NJ Politics at Rider University, told The Post, caveating that “we have a lot of voting left.” 3 Rep. Mikie Sherrill is widely seen as the frontrunner in the New Jersey governor’s race.

But Ciattarelli’s campaign has pushed his voters to cast their ballots early. Rasmussen also explained that Democrats outvoted Republicans on Election Day by about 140,000 in 2024 and 16,000 in 2022, while Republicans outvoted Dems by some 1,700 in 2021. “In any of those three historical examples,” Rasmussen added, “you can see how that [existing early vote gap] would be a tall order as compared with our experience with those past three elections.” Moreover, Democrats’ edge with in-person voting, which began on Saturday, 68,665 to 63,178, and has been growing, is also a larger advantage than Democrats had at this point in 2024. “Another strong in-person voting day for Democrats, as they improve their margin and raw turnout edge,” Pruser noted on Monday. “Republicans find themselves about 5 points behind where they were on this day in 2024, which is about 10 points behind where they want to be.” 3 Republican Jack Ciattarelli has dramatically overperformed polling expectations in the past. Yannick Peterhans / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images Democrats’ biggest advantage, however, is with mail-in voting, where they are outperforming Republicans by about 296,339 to 100,251, per Pruser’s data set. Still, while the early data is a positive sign for Sherrill, it leaves a lot of unknowns. Not all registered Dems will vote Democratic, and vice versa with Republicans. “I would caution observers to not make too many assumptions when they’re seeing Democrat or Republican ballots because there are going to be more Democratic crossover votes for Ciattarelli than there will be Republican crossover votes for Sherrill,” a source close to the Ciattarelli campaign cautioned The Post. They pointed to endorsements Ciattarelli received from North Jersey Democrats as evidence that the GOP hopeful will enjoy key crossover support. Ciattarelli lost by about 3 percentage points in his 2021 gubernatorial bid, massively overperforming expectations at the time. The RealClearPolitics aggregate underestimated him by about 5 percentage points at the time. 3 Democrats outvoted Republicans on Election Day by about 140,000 in 2024 and 16,000 in 2022, while Republicans outvoted Dems by some 1,700 in 2021. Leonardo Munoz Since then, New Jersey Republicans have netted more registered voters than Democrats, who still have a 860,000 voter advantage. The source underscored that the dynamics of the 2025 race will likely be fundamentally different than 2021 and 2024, predicting that Ciattarelli could enjoy a significant boost on Election Day. “It’s difficult to compare some of the returns to 2021, because in 2021, a lot of the early voting was relatively new. Remember, a lot of this was post-COVID,” the source added. “And in 2024, of course, there’s presidential-level turnouts.” “Traditionally, a gubernatorial election doesn’t reach presidential-level turnout.” Sherrill currently has a 3.8 percentage point lead over Ciattarelli in the latest RCP aggregate. “I don’t want to say that he’s [Ciattarelli is] out of it. I don’t think that at all,” Rasmussen stressed. “I think he’s very much in the game … but he has to do exceptionally well on Election Day.” Filed under democrats elections Jack Ciattarelli Mikie Sherrill new jersey voting 10/27/25 Read Next Mamdani didn’t tell the whole truth about his hijab-wear...

The reductions are part of an aggressive cost-cutting drive by Ellison and Shell as they attempt to integrate Paramount’s sprawling legacy businesses — which include CBS, Paramount Pictures, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount+ streaming service — into a leaner structure. Paramount Skydance is expected to disclose full details of its restructuring when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 10. As of December, Paramount employed about 18,600 full- and part-time workers worldwide and another 3,500 project-based staff, according to SEC filings. The firings mark the first major restructuring since Skydance Media completed its $8.4 billion merger with Paramount Global in August. Christopher Sadowski Ellison, 42, took over as CEO after engineering the merger that folded Shari Redstone’s Paramount Global into his privately held Skydance Media. The deal was largely financed by his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who retains significant influence as a backer of the new company. Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who now serves as Paramount Skydance’s president, has said since August that layoffs were coming quickly — with consulting firm Bain \u0026 Co. assisting in identifying $2 billion in annual savings, much of it from the company’s struggling linear TV networks. Before the merger closed, Paramount carried out several smaller rounds of staff reductions, including a 3.5% cut to its domestic workforce in June.

Rockne Roll, editor of The Jewish Review, slammed the DSA for booting him out of the meeting last week, calling it a “disservice” to his readers as four members of the Portland city council attended it to learn about “Israel’s illegal occupation, apartheid, or genocidal violence against Palestinians.” “I know there are a wide range of opinions about the Jewish state; out of respect for all of them, I made plans to attend and report what I saw fairly and accurately – just as I have endeavor to do on every story,” Roll wrote. 5 Rockne Roll, the editor of the The Jewish Review, said he was banned from a press conference held by Portland’s Democratic Socialists of America on Israel. jewishportland.org “Someone decided I shouldn’t have that chance. I was removed from the event before it even started,” he added. Roll is the sole staff member of the Review, an online bi-weekly paper owned by the Jewish Federation of Greater Portland.

Portland DSA 5 Councilmemeber Angelita Morillo was also participating in the DSA press conference. Portland DSA The DSA said that it was screening the attendees signing in to the event and removing any possible bad actors, claiming that Roll was not targeted over his role as a journalist for Portland’s only Jewish paper. “The exclusion of Mr. Roll was not intentional,” the DSA said in a statement. “Events relating to Palestine are often disrupted by trolls; the volunteers running the tech, who were making quick decisions to try to mitigate potential disruptions and distractions, mistakenly identified Rockne Roll as a fake name.” The group said that Roll was sent a recording of the call, which was later uploaded to YouTube, after learning about the mistake. 5 Olivia Katbi, co-chair of Portland DSA, moderated the press conference. Portland DSA 5 Dr. Travis Mellin, wearing a “Free Palestine” bracelet, participated in the conference. Portland DSA The DSA added that the city councilors who attended the event — Sameer Kanal, Angelita Morillo, Tiffany Koyama Lane and Mitch Green — had no role in how the call was operated. Roll, however, maintains that he did not use his name to register for the event, and his only identifier was his paper and his email address, which does not use his full name. A representative from Green’s office said the city councilors were not aware of the “technical difficulties” that took place during the event, the OregonLive reported.

Featured pricing is subject to change. From fancy gyms and gas stations to every corner of your social media feed, Celsius’ bright silver-and-white cans have built a global cult following. Now, the company is heading to the mountains. The ‘better-for-you’ energy drink brand has added a new twist to its lineup, one that could make a powerful impact on wellness-obsessed communities, fitness enthusiasts, partygoers, and even those dipping their toes in wellness culture and non-alcoholic beverage options. The limited-edition flavor has been crowned Spritz Vibe. “Spritz Vibe marks CELSIUS’ first limited edition flavor, and we knew we wanted to make this into a unique moment for the brand,” shared Chief Brand Officer Kyle Watson. “The inspiration came from après-ski culture… think snow-dusted mountains, cozy lodges, and a refreshing spritz shared with friends.” According to the brand, the Sparkling Snowball Frost flavor features a “velvety mix of winter-kissed citrus flavors.” And with its bright orange hue and chilled, mountain-inspired branding, it does look and sound like it belongs on a fancy mocktail menu. Lauren Wolfe, Macy Broyles, Sally Carden, Audrey Trullinger and Tatyana Lafata attend the CELSIUS Spritz Vibe Workout Hosted By Barry’s Miami Beach. Getty Images for CELSIUS To celebrate the launch, the brand treated longtime partners to a two-day Miami Beach getaway, packed with branded dinners, sweat-soaked VIP Barry’s workouts, ice baths, other recovery experiences, plus live performances at the iconic Palm Tree Club, featuring a DJ set by Loud Luxury. Curious how they maintained the energy for all that? The answer would probably be a whole lot of Celsius. “The event’s lively music performances and social moments celebrate our community and the authentic connection we share with consumers and partners,” shared Watson. “Together, they bring to life the après-ski energy behind CELSIUS Spritz Vibe — the perfect blend of performance and play, where energy meets celebration.” Guests included Love Island’s Nic Vansteenberghe, Bachelor alums Tyler Cameron and Maria Georgas, and longtime partner Brooks Nader. The lineup represents Celsius’ positioning in both entertainment and fitness spaces, and many of these stars have also helped amplify the brand on social media. With over 6 million TikTok followers, Celsius has undoubtedly built a strong relationship with the Gen Z market. David Dobrik and Brooks Nader holding Celsius Spritz Vibe cans at the launch party. Getty Images for CELSIUS Limited-edition releases continue to keep fans on their toes. Over the years, Celsius has released over 40 flavors, including sparkling classics, Fizz Free favorites, and the experiential “Vibe” line, which is meant to transport taste buds to destinations around the world. For the new Spritz Vibe, a playful Apres-Ski–style promo shows skiers sipping the new drink atop a sunny, snow-filled mountain. Another viral post shows the drink turned into a Spritz Vibe Snowball Slush Mocktail. The response has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic, with commentators calling it “the sip of the season” and others saying their “worlds are colliding.” @celsiusofficial Spritz Vibe. Limited Edition.

With trends like “Sober October” and “The Great Lock-In,” Gen Z has shown a strong focus on wellness — and less interest in alcohol. A 2023 Gallup survey found that roughly 38% of adults under 35 never drink, up 10% from two decades ago. While a few fans pointed out that the new flavor resembles an Aperol Spritz, Celsius Spritz Vibe is entirely non-alcoholic. Rather, it’s packed with functional ingredients. Celsius “As more consumers turn to wellness culture and non-alcoholic beverage options, CELSIUS delivers a zero-sugar energy drink and offers the fun and refreshing flavor of a traditional cocktail, without compromising a wellness-focused lifestyle,” explained Watson. Celsius drinks are zero sugar and contain no high fructose corn syrup or artificial colors. Each can packs in 200 milligrams of caffeine with green tea extract, guarana seed extract, and ginger root, along with a blend of essential vitamins like Vitamins B and C. Celsius’ flavor variety and messaging have won over many loyal consumers. In a crowded market, the brand seems to have found all the right ingredients.

CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss is looking to shake up the iconic TV news magazine — and casualties could include any number of the show’s star anchors, The Post has learned. The 41-year-old newshound was tapped this month to restore “balance” to the Tiffany Network’s news unit, according to David Ellison, CEO of CBS owner Paramount Skydance — and insiders say she believes “60 Minutes” has drifted too far to the left, sources said. 6 Bari Weiss, the network’s editor in chief, is looking to shake up “60 Minutes” and CBS News, sources said. Getty Images for The Free Press Among Weiss’s rumored targets, according to insiders, is Scott Pelley. The anchor slammed CBS’s then owner Paramount in an on-air tirade this summer for inking a $16 million settlement with President Trump over allegations that “60 Minutes” “deceptively edited a Kamala Harris interview. Likewise, Bill Whitaker, the correspondent who conducted the controversial Harris interview, may also be in the crosshairs after he was criticized for throwing softball questions and not vetting what was aired, sources said.

CBS via Getty Images For example, 83-year-old Lesley Stahl — who last year rebuffed President Trump’s demand that she apologize for dismissing The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story — is said to be thought of as a “treasure” by Weiss and may keep her role for some time longer, despite retirement rumors, according to a source. Another major question mark is how Tanya Simon – who succeeded Bill Owens as “60 Minutes” executive producer in a tumultuous, Trump-related reshuffle this summer – will fit into Weiss’s new regime, according to insiders. Simon — the daughter of late correspondent Bob Simon — appears to agree with Weiss that the show has “gone soft,” according to a well-placed source. Before Weiss’s arrival, Simon already had been looking to shuffle personnel to make the show “more hard hitting” and cut back on “soft entertainment pieces,” the source said. 6 According to sources, “60 Minutes” executive producer Tanya Simon has been frustrated with some of the softer pieces this season and is looking to shake up the ranks. CBS via Getty Images Neither Simon nor a rep for “60 Minutes” commented. “’60 Minutes’ has become the headquarters of book and movie launches,” an insider told The Post. “It is not the home of the investigative journalism of Mike Wallace anymore.” “60 Minutes” has had some strong reports last year, such as its Emmy Award-winning investigation on “Havana Syndrome.” But the the current season opened last month with a lightweight piece on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox calling for unity after Charlie Kirk’s murder and a puffy sit-down with UFC head Dana White, the source griped. 6 Scott Pelley, who has been a vocal critic of his network and President Trump, may be a target of the show’s overhaul. WireImage 6 Lesley Stahl, who is rumored to be heading for retirement soon, is said to be a favorite of Weiss. 60 Minutes/YouTube In a segment on Sunday, correspondent Cecilia Vega interviewed mentalist Oz Pearlman, who guessed the name of Vega’s third-grade teacher. “This reporting is afternoon cable fare,” a CBS source scoffed. “It is not ’60 Minutes’ caliber.” The overhaul comes as Weiss and CBS News president Tom Cibrowski are mulling whether to purge big names like “CBS Mornings” co-host Gayle King, whose eight-figure salary is hard to justify for the third-place show. Meanwhile, the network is expected to announce major headcount reductions Wednesday. “Big changes are coming,” said a source with knowledge of the matter. 6 “60 Minutes” veteran Bill Whitaker, whose interview with Kamala Harris was the subject of Trump’s lawsuit, has also been rumored to be a target of a revamp. 60 Minutes / CBS The person added that Weiss is focused on bringing back hard-hitting investigations — long part of CBS News’ DNA. Weiss has reportedly reached out to former CBS News investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge, who famously clashed with the network’s bosses as she broke stories on Hunter Biden’s laptop. “There’s not much of an investigative reporting unit anymore,” said a CBS News exec. “The reality is ‘60 Minutes’ is the investigative arm of CBS News.” On Monday, the network confirmed that “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson – who sources say is earning a couple million annually – would be retiring at the end of the year. Insiders expect his co-host Maurice DuBois to follow suit as Weiss and Cibrowski identify who would be best to anchor the show.

War correspondent Olena Hubanova, who worked under the pseudonym Alyona Gramova, and cameraman Yevhen Karmazin were killed Thursday when a Russian Lancet drone slammed into their car in Kramatorsk, about 12 miles from the front line. The duo are the latest journalists killed in the Ukraine war, with priest Viktor Zhyvchyk hailing them for their work during the side-by-side funeral service at St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery. 5 Loved ones gathered at Kyiv’s St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery for the services of slain journalists Olena Hubanova and Yevhen Karmazin. AP 5 The two were covering the frontlines of the Ukraine war in the Donetsk region when they were struck by a Russian drone. AP “Defending the truth is one of the highest forms of love for one’s neighbor,” Zhyvchyk said. “In their effort to show the truth to the world, these journalists gave their lives.” FreeDom, the state-funded station where Hubanova worked, said she was constantly working in the most dangerous areas in Donetsk, where the fighting remains the most intense as Russia continues its onslaught to try and conquer the oblast after nearly four years of war.

Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images 5 Ukrainian officials slammed the death of the journalist as an attempt from Russia to silence the truth of the war. AP “Attacks on journalists have become more frequent. The enemy sees it as a kind of victory,” Mykhaliuk said. Donetsk region Gov. Vadym Filashkin, who confirmed the journalists’ death on Thursday, said they had been well-known in the oblast for their coverage of the carnage that has taken place for more than three years. “Since the first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion, they covered events in the Donetsk region, telling the truth about enemy crimes, evacuations of civilians and the stories of our defenders,” Filashkin said in a statement. 5 The church hailed Hubanova and Karmazin for their commitment to report from the dangerous of the frontlines. Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images “They were always among the first to arrive in the hottest spots,” he added. Strikes on journalists covering the war have been common, with at least 135 media workers killed since Russia first launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to Ukraine’s National Union of Journalists. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky slammed the strike that killed Hubanova and Karmazin — which left another reporter injured — as an attempt to silence the truth of the ongoing siege in Donetsk. “These are not accidents or mistakes, but a deliberate Russian strategy to silence all independent voices reporting about Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine,” Zelensky wrote on X.

Sinner, who was linked to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Brooks Nader last month, acknowledged Hasanovic in his speech after a thrilling comeback to defeat Alexander Zverev in the tennis championship. “Everyone here — my family, girlfriend, friends,” Jannik, 24, said while holding his trophy. “My whole team, also watching at home, thank you so much for the support.” Hasanovic, 24, was smiling and clapping as the Tennis Channel cameras captured her standing with his friends and family in Austria, including parents Johann Sinner and Siglinde Sinner. Sinner, who won his first Erste Bank Open title in 2023, joins tennis icons Roger Federer and Andy Murray as the only ATP No. 1 Club members to have won twice in Vienna.

Sinner and Hasanovic made waves when some internet sleuths saw him checking his phone following a third-round victory over Denis Shapovalov at this year’s U.S. Open, and claimed his wallpaper featured a snapshot of Hasanovic — specifically a snapshot of her smiling from a July brand post for Armani Beauty. 4 Italy’s Jannik Sinner poses with the trophy after winning the Vienna Open final against Germany’s Alexander Zverev on October 26, 2025.

During an appearance on “Watch What Happens Live,” Nader had a cheeky response to rumors that she was dating Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz at the same time while they battled on the court at this year’s U.S. Open. “I mean, I would just say a lady never kisses and tells, especially twice,” Brooks, 28, said, laughing during the Sept. 17 episode. “Thats just not nice, especially twice.” 4 Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz (L) and Jannik Sinner (R) pose after the men’s singles final at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, on September 7, 2025.

About 90% of the billions of dollars and massive job haul from 648 Israeli-founded businesses was focused in the five boroughs, according to findings by the United States-Israel Business Alliance. 4 How The Post told the story of Zohran Mamdani’s refusal to say Hamas should stop fighting Israel. The CEO of an Israeli biotech company told The Post his business could be another to flourish for the Big Apple — but that a Mamdani administration would make him think twice about landing in the city because of the leading Democratic nominee’s staunch criticism of the Jewish state. “I need to see if his words have any meaningful impact on the ground,” said the company exec, who did not want to be identified, as the city prepares to elect its next mayor Nov. 4. “If someone on our team is moving to New York, I want them to be in a pleasant area where they don’t feel fearful, or, from a business perspective, deal with people that are shying away because the company’s Israeli,” the CEO said.

Getty Images The nearly 650 Israeli-founded firms already doing business in the Empire State have directly created 28,524 jobs and a total of 57,145 jobs when accounting for related factors, the New York-Israel Economic Impact Report states. Out of the total number of jobs, about 88% were concentrated in the city. About $13.3 billion in total value was added to the state economy through the firms, with $12.4 billion just in the city alone, the study found. “When Israeli tech entrepreneurs think about entering the US market or positioning their companies for global growth, New York City is at the top of the list,” US-Israeli Business Alliance President Aaron Kaplowitz said in a statement. 4 US-Israeli Business Alliance President Aaron Kaplowitz said New York typically has a great “cosmopolitan appeal” for firms. Aaron Kaplowitz “Ultimately, this cosmopolitan appeal translates into more local jobs and more money flowing through the city’s economy.” But the biotech CEO said that appeal might not be enough to keep firms or attract new ones, depending who is the next mayor. He said he is weighing taking his firm to either New York and Boston — and stressed that Mamdani’s performances in the debates and other remarks he has made have not been reassuring. The war in Gaza has been a focal point for mayoral candidates this year. The CEO specifically cited Mamdani refusing to say Israel should exist as a Jewish state and his reported soft stance on Hamas. 4 Mamdani enjoys a significant lead in the mayoral race. James Messerschmidt “[Mamdani’s] words might not affect policy, but if the head of the city keeps repeating anti-Israel rhetoric, it can definitely have an effect,” the biz exec said. “And that’s something we’ll need to take into account.” The company head said he and other Jews don’t understand why Mamdani has taken such a hard stance on Israel when the city has such a high Jewish population. “And if it causes Israeli companies to leave New York, obviously it will have a major impact on the economy,” the CEO argued. “I have Israeli friends who moved to New York with the Israeli companies that they are working for, and they’ve been there for years, and they’ve described to me after Oct. 7 how difficult it’s been to live in the city.” While Mamdani has faced criticism over statements about Israel, the mayoral front-runner going up against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa has vowed to protect Jewish New Yorkers against a rise in antisemitism.

The trouble began when Whitpain Township police tried to pull the Mercedes G-Wagen over and Janiczek allegedly took off, driving over the center median and barreling against traffic on the Skippack Pike on Friday afternoon. He eluded police, but cops spotted the SUV in the parking lot of a Doubletree Guest Suites Hotel in Plymouth Township about 40 minutes later – and that’s when all hell broke loose. 4 Janiczek, 21, fled a traffic stop, then mowed down two cops when they found him Friday, authorities said. FOX According to the complaint, Janiczek rammed several patrol vehicles and struck one cop and knocked him to the ground – then turned around and hit him three more times. Police fired five shots at the windshield but failed to stop the crazed driver – leaving him with a graze wound to the head, the complaint said. One eyewitness to the mayhem outside the hotel told investigators that Janiczek “’intentionally’ ran over the officer” and “heard the officer yelling for help,” prosecutors said. 4 Janiczek is a member of the Loyola Marymount University rowing team. Loyola Marymount Janiczek, the son of Lee Janiczek, a partner with the prominent law firm of Lewis Brisbois and a member of the rowing team at Loyola Marymount University, is due back in court Nov. 4.

A Nassau County high school teaches respect for nature in an incredibly unique way — by caring for several exotic animals like peacocks and a pack of furry friends that kids have fallen in love with. “We say that one trip to the dog is worth two to the counselor,” Brother Kenneth Hoagland, principal of Kellenberg Memorial High School, told The Post. 9 Kevin Wells, the groundskeeper at Kellenberg Memorial High School, checks on the seven peacocks on the school grounds.

The Uniondale-based Catholic academy brought in two new puppies for the school year, an adorable Samoyed named Magnus, and a miniature Bernese named Frassati after Saint Pier Giorgio Frassati. They join the entire Kellenberg pound in roaming the halls where they welcome students’ love — and rubs — during academic hours. Magnus, who has a cushy bed in Hoagland’s office, leaped up as he was petted by more than 50 kids heading to class in between periods on Friday. “Having the dogs, the kids put their screens away … it becomes more relational,” added Hoagland, who said school staff read a book over the summer on why today’s teens have heightened anxiety. See Also Long Island school recruits adorable ‘celebrity’ dog to fight goose poop epidemic: ‘It’s a real problem’ “There’s an important part of their education that needs to be real, concrete, not on the screen — and something that relates to beauty and relates to a sensitivity of what’s humane.” Kellenberg’s guidance department also uses the dogs to help students de-stress, welcome anxious students pulling up on the first day of class, and help lure in newcomers during open houses. “It’s definitely a very calming moment, just to be able to step away from reality for as little as possible and be able to hang out with the dogs,” said senior Kiera Cook. The 12th grader is one of many students who enthusiastically take the pups on walks during free periods. “That was a very big reason why I wanted to come here … hundreds will come up and ask to pet them,” added Cook, who has grown especially close to Frassati. 9 This white parrot is one of many at Kellenberg Memorial High School.

Clark Magnus and Frassati — Brother Hoagland said both are, by God’s grace, housebroken — joined the family after the school lost its beloved dog, Beato, in August. “The condolence cards I received spoke very loudly,” said Hoagland. “There was a place in the hearts of the students that we knew they would like to see another dog.” Noah’s ark See Also The internet’s new top dog is an adorable, subway-riding bear-cloud Kellenberg is also home to seven peacocks and their female counterparts, peahens, as well as half a dozen parrots. The copycat birds, which can live to the age of 90, were all donated by people and the elderly who could no longer care for them. Parrots in the front area of Kellenberg occasionally dance for lucky passersby. “When I tell my friends at public school that we really have every different kind of animal here, they don’t believe me,” said Cook. The tradition began about 30 years ago, when the school’s brass wanted to lean into Kellenberg’s apt team name, the Firebirds, and cheaply acquired a male and a female peacock for around $300. “After that, we’ve had other offspring … so many in fact that a family actually adopted some of ours,” added Hoagland. 9 A blue and gold macaw perches on a branch in a glass enclosure at Kellenberg Memorial High School.

Landscape supervisor Kevin Wells Hardy said the colorful birds are “self-sufficient” and don’t need much upkeep beyond feeding and headcounts. While the peacocks also “love it here,” they can still be startled by unfamiliar noises and have escaped in the past, Wells Hardy added. “They can fly and they will fly away,” he said. “There have been instances where we had to go outside of the school to retrieve them and bring them back. … You will never find anything like this anywhere else.” Filed under animals birds catholic schools cute animals dogs high schools nature peacocks schools 10/27/25 Read Next 2 Long Island sisters charged with gang assault after alle...

The rider sped past traffic on the 210 Freeway at speeds up to 170 mph before slamming into an oncoming car, wild aerial footage from FOX 11 showed. 3 A motorcycle chase on Monday ended with a horrifying wipe out on the Los Angeles freeway. FOX Sheriff’s deputies were responding to a domestic violence report of an armed Hispanic man threatening a woman in the suburb of Rancho Cucamonga when the suspect began shooting at the officers, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “One deputy was struck and was airlifted to a hospital. The suspect fled the location on a motorcycle and was pursued along the eastbound 210-freeway,” it added. The perp — whom initial reports said robbed a shopping mall — wove through afternoon traffic before taking his hands off the handlebars to adjust a backpack, the video shows. 3 The rider went flying off the bike. FOX That’s when he slammed into the back of a sedan — sending the suspect cartwheeling through the air and skidding onto his back before the bike rolled over him, a wheel seeming to miss his head by inches, the harrowing footage shows. The car that clipped the motorcycle was being driven by an off-duty narcotics officer conducting a “legal intervention,” the sheriff’s department later clarified.

Aerial footage near the scene of the initial shootout showed a patrol vehicle’s window shattered and a bloody police vest on the ground, according to FOX 11. The wounded deputy, later identified as San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Deputy Andrew Nunez, died in the shooting, the office posted in an update Monday evening. He was struck by a bullet once in the head and was rushed to the hospital before being pronounced dead around 1 p.m., NBC4 reported. 3 First responders were quickly on the scene on Monday. KNBC Nunez leaves behind his wife, who was pregnant with their second child, a 2-year-old daughter, his mother and four brothers and sisters, Sheriff Shannon Dicus announced in a press conference on Monday. “We’re embedded in sorrow,” Dicus told reporters. Nunez was a six-year veteran with the department, the sheriff added. “Deputy Nunez served with unwavering commitment, courage, and deep compassion for the community he vowed to protect,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. “His bravery and sacrifice reflect a life dedicated to safeguarding others, even at the greatest cost. Such devotion will remain forever etched in our hearts,” cops wrote. San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson said his office intends to look into charging the suspect with the murder of a peace officer. The suspect is in stable condition in an area hospital, Dicus said. The investigation into the incident remains ongoing. Officers were waiting to interview the suspect as of Monday afternoon.

Mikie Sherrill will host drag queen event days after election By Chris Nesi Published Oct. 27, 2025, 5:13 p.m. ET New Jersey’s influential teachers union — which has thrown its support behind Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill in the upcoming governor’s race — will host a woke event just two days after next month’s election, celebrating “the vibrant world of drag.” The event, dubbed “Drag is not a Crime: The Past, Present, and Future of Drag,” will be part of the 200,000-member New Jersey Education Association union’s annual convention in Atlantic City, the graphic for which notably lists “equity” and “justice” ahead of “learning.” 3 The massive NJ teachers union is hosting a pro-drag event and a number of other “woke” programming options at its upcoming convention in Atlantic City. AFP via Getty Images 3 A Ciattarelli strategist told The Post, “Drag might not be a crime, but looking the other way while 80% of third graders in some of New Jersey’s schools can’t read at grade level should be.” Kyle Mazza/Shutterstock The NJEA Consortium, a project bankrolled by the union that describes itself as “on a mission to put diversity and representation at the forefront of curriculum development,” lists the drag event on its calendar for the weekend conference — which draws thousands of educators from the Garden State and beyond. “This presentation explores drag’s history, cultural significance, and future, showing how it serves as art, resistance, and activism — challenging norms, advancing LGBTQ+ rights, and promoting social justice and community,” the event’s description reads.

Aristide Economopoulos “Drag might not be a crime, but looking the other way while 80% of third graders in some of New Jersey’s schools can’t read at grade level should be,” Ciattarelli strategist Chris Russell said in a statement to The Post. “The NJEA and far-left politicians like Mikie Sherrill could care less about education or teachers.

The NJEA — headed up by failed NJ gubernatorial candidate Sean Spiller — has previously promoted drag-focused events at the annual gathering for public school teachers, including a “historic convention first” drag queen story hour in 2022. “Drag queens Astala Vista and Vinchelle hosted ‘LGBTQIA+ Banned Books – Drag Queen Story Hour’ to answer questions from the audience, take photos in all their dazzling iridescence with NJEA members, and to read ‘And Tango Makes Three,’ ‘Prince and Knight,’ and ‘I am Jazz,\u0027” NJEA said while touting the event. “I am Jazz,” published in 2014, tells the story of a transgender child’s struggle from the age of two with having “a girl brain but a boy body.” Filed under drag queens governors Jack Ciattarelli Mikie Sherrill new jersey teachers union 10/27/25 Read Next Why many NYC Democrats will never vote for Zohran Mamdani,...

Judge Published Oct. 27, 2025, 5:06 p.m. ET Since Congress passed President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” this summer, strong real-GDP growth has combined with minimal inflation, boosting American prosperity. But one potential misstep could end this decisive, action-oriented administration’s hope of making the American economy great again — while losing the midterm elections and Republican control of the government. The Trump team is oddly frozen over what to do about the so-called “Basel Accords,” rules developed decades ago to introduce capital standards into the then rapidly developing international banking space — but which instead arguably led the global economy into repeated disaster. President Trump arriving at Haneda airport in Tokyo on Oct. 27, 2025. Kyodo/via REUTERS At issue is the proposed expansion of the Basel rules to American community banks. Developed between the mid-1970s and late ’80s, the Basel rules followed the surprise 1974 failures of two large but second-tier banks, one in the United States, the other in Germany. Experts at the time attributed both collapses to recklessness in the rapidly growing but largely unregulated global financial trading markets.

For the next decade and a half, coordinating through the Bank of International Settlement in Basel, Switzerland, central banks and national regulators . . . talked. While they talked, the markets saw no repeat of the 1974 scare. Actually, President Ronald Reagan’s deregulated 1980s were so stable that economists now call those years “The Great Moderation.” But at last, in 1989, 28 central banks and their partner regulators announced they had agreed on a plan. They seemed particularly proud that the plan included strong new rules requiring banks to hold 8% bank capital against the sum of their outstanding loans. Loans to major corporations (think Apple, Intel or Ford) would mean setting additional percentages aside — “risk weighting,” as it was called. Home mortgages and loans to countries, whether unstable ones like Greece or behemoths like the United States, were considered riskless and required no additional capital to be held. The equity capital mandate reduced lenders’ profitability, so the set-asides all but forced banks to load up their portfolios with loans in categories that required no additional capital: mortgages and national debt.

Check out more newsletters The early rules were rolled out in stages: Basel I (launched from July 1988 to the end of ’92) and Basel II (April 2008 through December ’12). In practice, raising bank capital to 8% of loans outstanding was mostly achieved by reducing the volume of outstanding loans — which, by definition, meant reducing the nation’s money supply. Milton Friedman taught that the US economy takes six to nine months to respond to movements in the quantity of money. Considering that US banks were brought under the new rules in stages, biggest to smallest, it’s a good bet that Basel I was at least partially, and perhaps entirely, responsible for the 1991 economic downturn that cost President George H.W. Bush reelection and sent Bill Clinton to the White House. And it’s a sure bet that, with so much money essentially mandated to go into the mortgage market, Basel I induced a mortgage bubble. A few years later, the Basel II rollout triggered another downturn — and, in 2007-’09, the traumatic popping of that bubble. The financial crisis and the Great Recession followed, as did the election of Barack Obama. Now, the same group of regulators has proposed to extend the Basel rules. It’s known as Basel III Endgame — and the Trump administration appears to be paralyzed. “Experts” assure us that the Basel-mandated capital reserve rules make the banking systems safer. In theory they may be right. But each new rollout has triggered a downturn, as misjudgments about the incentives that the rules created massively added fuel to the fire. The Trump administration is in a stand-off over rolling out Basel III Endgame, which would extend risk-weighting algorithms developed by global “experts” even further. Adopting it would mean hometown bankers sensitive to details of local life and business will no longer independently decide the financing available to small businesses and other local entities in the United States. If American local business financing is to be great again, we must return to our long-held respect for experience-informed practice. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke wrote that the new rules may “constitute a structural impediment to the supply side of the American economy.” Trump should take note. Does he really want to give global regulators the power to pull the trigger on the next Basel rollout in the next few months — just in time to roil the economy ahead of the midterm elections that will determine the future of his MAGA agenda? The president and his astute Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent need to decide — and act now. Clark S.

The stolen trove containing 3.5 terabytes of data surfaced online this month, according to Troy Hunt, the Australian security researcher who runs the breach-notification site Have I Been Pwned. Hunt stated that the information originated from a yearlong sweep of “infostealer” platforms — malware networks that secretly siphon usernames, passwords and website addresses from infected devices. The data consists of both “stealer logs and credential stuffing lists,” Hunt wrote in a blog post. 4 A massive breach has exposed more than 183 million email passwords, including tens of millions linked to Gmail accounts. ajayptp – stock.adobe.com “Someone logging into Gmail ends up with their email address and password captured against gmail.com.” Explore More What every investor needs to know about gold’s historic rally — whether it continues or not Amazon to cut 30,000 corporate jobs — 9% of worldwide office workforce: report New matcha teahouse in NYC’s Flatiron District offers scintillating Japanese ceremonies The new dataset contained 183 million unique accounts, including roughly 16.4 million addresses never seen before in any prior breach, Hunt wrote. To find out if their credentials are among those compromised, users can visit HaveIBeenPwned.com and enter their email addresses. If flagged, the site provides the date and nature of the breach. Security firm Synthient, which collected the logs, said the records were drawn from criminal marketplaces and underground Telegram channels where hackers share stolen credentials in bulk. Analyst Benjamin Brundage of Synthient said the findings show the staggering reach of infostealer malware. According to researchers, most of the entries are recycled from older breaches, but millions of newly compromised Gmail accounts were verified when affected users confirmed that exposed passwords still matched their active credentials. 4 The stolen trove surfaced online this month. Jess rodriguez – stock.adobe.com The leak, first detected in April and made public last week, covers not only Gmail data, but also login information for Outlook, Yahoo and hundreds of other web services. The cache, Hunt said, shows how stolen credentials often reappear across forums for years, giving criminals fresh opportunities to exploit reused passwords. Hunt said the breaches did not involve a direct hack of Gmail; it employed malware on users’ computers that captured their logins. Security experts said that’s why the impact of the breaches extends far beyond email. Many victims reuse passwords across multiple sites — from cloud storage and banking to social media — enabling attackers to infiltrate victims’ entire digital lives through “credential stuffing,” the automated process of testing stolen username–password pairs on multiple platforms. “Reports of a Gmail security ‘breach’ impacting millions of users are entirely inaccurate and incorrect,” a Google spokesperson told The Post. “They stem from a misreading of ongoing updates to credential theft databases, known as infostealer activity, whereby attackers employ various tools to harvest credentials versus a single, specific attack aimed at any one person, tool or platform.” “We encourage users to follow best practices to protect themselves from credential theft, such as turning on 2-step verification and adopting passkeys as a stronger and safer alternative to passwords, and resetting passwords when they are exposed in large batches like this.” 4 To find out if their credentials are among those compromised, users can visit HaveIBeenPwned.com and enter their email address. Have I Been Pwned Cybersecurity experts worldwide urged Gmail users to act right away. “If you’re one of the 183 million people affected, you need to change your email password immediately and enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t already,” Hunt said. British security analyst Michael Tigges of Huntress told Yahoo News that while Gmail itself wasn’t directly breached, the attack should be a wake-up call for anyone who relies on their web browsers to store their credentials. “The event here is not one of any specific data breach, but instead aggregated and uploaded data from millions of stealer malware logs,” Tigges said. “This underscores the importance of avoiding shared credentials across services and highlights why it is important to have excellent visibility on both your personal email security, as well as business email security.” Fellow security blogger Graham Cluley told the Daily Mail that people should “always use different passwords for different online accounts” and store them in encrypted password managers rather than browsers, which malware can easily scrape. Google’s own Password Manager Checkup tool also scans saved logins in Chrome and warns of weak, reused or breached passwords. The company said it automatically prompts password resets when large credential dumps are detected. Researchers noted that most of the stolen credentials were likely harvested through fake software downloads, phishing attachments, or browser extensions. Victims often have no idea their devices were infected. 4 A Google spokesperson confirmed the company is aware of the leak and is taking steps to safeguard users. Sundry Photography – stock.adobe.com The most important step is prevention, Tigges said. “Make sure your anti-virus is up to date and that you’re downloading software from reputable sources,” he said. “These credentials were obtained primarily through ‘stealer’ type malware; prevention is the chief mitigation.” While the scale of the data dump appears to be unprecedented, Hunt emphasized that the real threat comes from complacency. “Reusing passwords is a recipe for disaster,” he explained. Experts warned that attackers could weaponize the database for months or years by selling verified Gmail logins to fraud networks.

WKYC Channel 3/YouTube A jury rejected her insanity defense for the ghastly murder of young Julian Wood, who she viciously stabbed in the face and back with a pair of stolen butcher knives in the parking lot of a Giant Eagle grocery store in the Cleveland suburb of North Olmstead in June 2024. The boy’s mother, Margot, was also injured as she frantically tried to save her son by yanking him out of the shopping cart during the nightmarish assault, the court heard.

Margot also spoke at the hearing, addressing Ellis directly and telling her “I hate you with every fiber of my being” as she stared her down. “I watched him take his first breath when he was born and his last when he died in my arms, covered in blood,” said Margot. “The last thing I will ever hear from my son is his scream.

Sources told Reuters the reductions — which amount to 9% of Amazon’s global office-based workforce of 350,000 — will begin Tuesday and could unfold over several weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Seattle-based web giant’s sweeping layoffs mark the biggest in a series of major contractions for the company, which has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since CEO Andy Jassy took over from the company’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, Jassy cut a total of 27,000 jobs, Reuters reported. Those cuts targeted Amazon Web Services, its devices group and entertainment units including Prime Video and Twitch. 4 Amazon is preparing to eliminate about 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday — another major contraction under CEO Andy Jassy. ZUMA24.com Reuters reported that this week’s layoffs could reach across multiple departments, among them human resources — known internally as the People Experience and Technology group — as well as devices, services and operations. Explore More 183M email passwords exposed in data leak — how to check if yours is safe What every investor needs to know about gold’s historic rally — whether it continues or not New matcha teahouse in NYC’s Flatiron District offers scintillating Japanese ceremonies Managers in affected areas were instructed Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief employees once email notifications start going out Tuesday morning, sources told Reuters. The latest reductions come as Amazon doubles down on artificial intelligence and robotics — technologies Jassy has described as central to the company’s next phase of growth. In a companywide email in June, Jassy warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind, writing that those who “become conversant in AI” would be best positioned to “help us reinvent the company.” He also acknowledged that Amazon expected “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company” that would reduce the corporate workforce. 4 The new cuts follow reports earlier this month that Amazon was planning to downsize its human resources arm and other divisions as part of a broader cost-cutting drive. Christopher Sadowski “AI is allowing Amazon to cut major costs and playing a key role here around efficiency along with other cost cuts,” Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities, told The Post. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon was preparing to cut up to 15% of its People eXperience and Technology division, known internally as PXT — a 10,000-person unit that includes recruiting and HR tech teams. Those layoffs are believed to be part of the new 30,000 total. The scale of the latest cuts positions Amazon among the largest corporate downsizers of 2025, alongside Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which have also trimmed staff as AI investments reshape the tech industry. The company has been aggressively reining in costs while committing more than $100 billion in capital spending this year to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure. Amazon’s push to automate its operations has intensified in recent months. 4 Jassy has been pursuing a broad campaign to streamline Amazon’s management structure, arguing that the company had become weighed down by unnecessary layers of oversight. Christopher Sadowski Internal strategy documents reviewed by The New York Times showed the company aims to replace more than 500,000 jobs with robots and automate 75% of its fulfillment operations by 2033. Executives have told the board that automation could allow Amazon to avoid hiring hundreds of thousands of additional workers in the US while doubling sales volume. Amazon said at the time that the internal documents did not represent its official hiring strategy and that the company would continue to create new jobs in logistics and technology. Jassy’s cost-cutting measures have included mandatory return-to-office policies, stricter performance management and an annual process known internally as “unregretted attrition,” which encourages managers to push out underperformers. 4 Sources told Reuters the reductions will begin Tuesday and could unfold over several weeks. AFP via Getty Images The company’s corporate workforce ballooned during the pandemic as online shopping surged. Since then, Jassy has sought to reverse that expansion while redirecting resources toward more profitable segments like AWS and advertising. Amazon’s stock has risen about 20% over the past year but remains volatile amid investor scrutiny over its long-term profitability. While corporate layoffs loom, Amazon said it still plans to hire 250,000 seasonal warehouse and delivery workers for the holiday rush — most of them temporary roles. Jassy has been pursuing a broad campaign to streamline Amazon’s management structure, arguing that the company had become weighed down by unnecessary layers of oversight. Earlier this year, he said an anonymous feedback channel created to flag inefficiencies had drawn about 1,500 submissions and prompted more than 450 process changes.

With so many sports overlapping in October, it is easy for one of the NBA’s unheralded teams to fly under the radar during the regular season’s first week. But the Utah Jazz have quietly started as a pleasant surprise, winning their first game in blowout fashion as a double-digit underdog and also covering in a one-point loss. The Jazz visit the Phoenix Suns on Monday, and they should be lined as a short underdog once the betting odds are posted.

Antoan Richardson, the team’s first base/baserunning coach who survived a staff purge after the season and was invited to return, is “far apart” with the Mets on terms of a new contract, according to industry sources, and is expected to depart the organization. Richardson, 42, was credited with the team’s success stealing bases this season. Most significantly he was a favorite of Juan Soto, who stole a career-high 38 bases and publicly credited Richardson for his success. “The two of them are tight,” a person close to Soto said.

Mets hiring Troy Snitker as hitting coach as they rebuild staff after overhaul Mets coach Desi Druschel making crosstown switch back to Yankees The Yankees have an opening for a first base coach, and a person connected to Richardson indicated he could be a candidate for the job. Richardson joined Mets manager Carlos Mendoza’s staff before the 2024 season after four seasons as a Giants coach. On Monday, the Mets hired Troy Snitker — the son of former Braves manager Brian Snitker — as a hitting coach. Snitker will work under Jeff Albert, who was recently promoted from his minor league position to oversee the major league Mets hitting program. Mets first base coach Antoan Richardson reacts after a home run by Juan Soto. AP Snitker, 36, previously served as a hitting coach for the Astros (where he worked with Albert). Snitker was part of the Astros coaching staff for the team’s 2022 World Series championship. Richardson would become the seventh Mets coach not to return for next season. After the second-half nosedive that ended with the Mets missing the postseason, bench coach John Gibbons stepped aside and catching instructor Glenn Sherlock retired. Hitting coaches Eric Chavez and Jeremy Barnes were fired and pitching coach Jeremy Hefner’s 2026 option was declined. Third base coach Mike Sarbaugh was informed his contract would not be renewed. The Mets have since hired Kai Correa as their new bench coach, in addition to Albert and Snitker for the hitting department. ESPN first reported Richardson’s likely departure.

The kings of New Jersey will be spending quite a bit of time in the Big Apple next summer. Due to overwhelming demand, Bon Jovi just added a fifth concert at New York City’s Madison Square Garden as part of their short 2026 ‘Forever Tour.’ Their MSG shows are set to go down: Tuesday, July 7 7:30 p.m. Thursday, July 9 7:30 p.m. Sunday, July 12 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 14 7:30 p.m. Thursday, July 16 7:30 p.m. A little over a month after the mini residency at the Knicks and Rangers’ home, the “Livin’ On A Prayer” rockers head across the pond for a quick run of shows in the United Kingdom. These concerts will serve as the group’s first official tour since they took their hits on the road in spring 2022. They’ve been on a hiatus — save for the odd one-off show — since then due to frontman Jon Bon Jovi’s vocal surgery. With that now in the rearview mirror though, the powerful vocalist is itching to see his fans Bonjoviologists yet again. “…I’m deeply grateful that the fans and the brotherhood of this band have been patient and allowed me the time needed to get healthy and prepare for touring,” the 63-year-old frontman shared in a statement. I’m ready and excited!” Prior to the tour, the Grammy winners are celebrating the re-release of their 2024 album “Forever.” On this new version, high-profile special guests like Bruce Springsteen, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Jason Isbell, Carin Leon and others joined the rockers in a reimagining of the record.

In fact, he didn’t get a majority of votes in the first round against Andrew Cuomo, Brad Landers, and others. The Post spoke to several “never Mamdani” Democrats from across the city about what worries them about the frontrunner, from his anti-business policies to his lack of understanding of working class struggles: ‘He wants to turn this metropolis into a college town’ 16 Tillard worries that Mamdani’s anti-capitalist views will hurt the job market his community needs to thrive. Tamara Beckwith “If you know anything about Black history since the great migration, it was only by purchasing private property that we were able to gain economic empowerment in New York City … So, anybody against private property, in my view, is against most of black wealth,” Pastor Conrad Tillard of the Congregational Church of South Hempstead told The Post. Tillard, 61, who retired last year from teaching Black Studies at City College of New York and lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, originally supported Eric Adams. He says black people “do not know,” Mamdani and will “stick with Cuomo,” who he will also vote for.

You don’t try to make New York into Cambridge, Massachusetts. That’s what these gentrifiers are doing,” he said of Mamdani. “The bike lanes, the pedestrian plazas, congestion pricing. They’re trying to make this great metropolis into a college town.” 16 Conrad Tillard says young gentrifiers often don’t understand the history of the city they live in. Tamara Beckwith 16 Tillard believes politicians should embrace and tweak New York, not radically change it. Tamara Beckwith ‘I’m moving out if he wins’ Mamdani’s promises to bring prices down rings hollow with East Village resident Andrew Bernstein, who also believes his plan to freeze rent in stabilized apartments won’t work. “The city’s already unaffordable … The whole housing situation in New York is so fundamentally broken and ridiculous, and Mamdani’s approach to it is the opposite of what is needed,” Bernstein explained. “It just brings the rent up for everyone else [not stabilized].” 16 Andrew Bernstein plans to leave New York City if Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor. Courtesy of Andrew Bernstein 16 Bernstein says Mamdani’s lack of experience and former comments about the police are worrying to him. REUTERS Bernstein, 28, a Democrat who supported Zellnor Myrie in the primary, said he’ll move out if Mamdani wins – most likely to Florida or New Jersey – a move a quarter of New Yorkers are reportedly considering. “I think if people have the flexibility to leave, they will … I think [Mamdani’s] pandering and trying to wait out the election. I don’t think he actually believes in any of this stuff [he’s now saying]. He’s really a socialist.” ‘I know socialism fails because my family fled it’ Phil Wong of Elmhurst, Queens, knows socialism doesn’t work after his family fled mainland China to be free from it. He warns Mamdani’s supporters think they’ll get “free healthcare, free buses, free rents … [but] nothing is free.” Wong, 59, served as president of the Community Education Council for New York City’s 24th district and is particularly worried about Mamdani canceling gifted and talented programs. 16 Phil Wong says that parents know best when it comes to education. Tamara Beckwith 16 Wong is, himself, running for City Council as a Democrat in Queens. Tamara Beckwith “If he follows his group of people, the young hipsters that never had kids or never sat on a school board, that will be very harmful. “The parents know best. I have three daughters, and I know there is a high demand for [these programs], and now you want to get rid of it? We’re going to have a mass exodus of kids.” Wong, a self-described moderate Democrat, is throwing his hat into the ring in his local City Council race in Queens, where he says crime is rampant and more cops are needed — something he fears will get worse in a Mamdani New York. ‘Where is the money going to come from to make it free?’ Alicia Barksdale, 64, of Harlem, is a former toll collector at bridges and tunnels for the MTA, who thinks Mamdani’s plan to make buses free doesn’t add up. “Where is the money going to come from to [make] it free? My eyebrows are going up, because, okay, you’re young… Saying free transportation is really saying to people you’re going to be losing jobs,” she said, explaining the MTA won’t have enough revenue to pay drivers and might force them into early retirement. 16 Alicia Barksdale is concerned that a Mamdani victory could jeopardize New York City’s federal funding. Tamara Beckwith 16 Barksdale supported Cuomo in the primary election and will again vote for him in November. Tamara Beckwith She also worries a Mamdani victory will cause Trump to pull federal funding for the city — and the least fortunate will suffer most. “So you’re just going to jeopardize them, when they’re already struggling,” Barksdale told The Post. “When the city loses everything, he’s going to be a one-term mayor.” ‘His views would be comical if they weren’t so scary’ “His ideological point of view would be comical if it wasn’t so scary,” entrepreneur Jason Pomeranc told The Post. The 54-year-old lifelong Democrat was born in Queens and resides in Manhattan. He co-founded the SIXTY and Thompson Hotel Groups and thinks Mamdani’s anti-capitalist views and past anti-police rhetoric will hurt business in the city. 16 Jason Pomeranc says that Mamdani’s policies could harm local businesses and the economy in general. Stefano Giovannini “I don’t think Mamdani has a clear understanding of how important hospitality is, and how each decision he makes can have a ripple effect. “Harboring hostility to some of the bravest and committed individuals in the city betrays a lack of understanding of public safety … People don’t feel safe walking around the streets of their home, tourists don’t feel safe walking around the streets of the city… I’m deeply concerned as someone who lives here that things could unravel quickly.” 16 Pomeranc is concerned that a Mamdani victory would send the Democratic Party the wrong message. Stefano Giovannini ‘I’m worried for my children’s safety’ Sarah Sarway, a Jewish mother of a one-year-old with a second on the way, worries a victory by Mamdani, who supports boycotting Israel, could make her community less safe. The 34-year-old from Midwood, Brooklyn, is a lifelong Democrat raised in a Republican family. She says she always ignored conservative media — but she thinks they’re right about Mamdani. “I was always rolling my eyes, trying not to listen to the media they were consuming just villainizing Democrats,” the marketing professional said. “But Mamdani is really as bad as they’re saying he is … they’re not exaggerating.” 16 Sarah Sarway, a Jewish mother, worries for her family’s safety if Mamdani wins. 16 Sarway is concerned that anti-Israel protests — like this one at Columbia University in April 2024 — could get out of hand under Mamdani’s mayorship. James Keivom 16 Sarway says young Democrats are so radical that they’ve alienated her. Cuomo supporter Sarway says “Israel is always an issue in the back of [her] head” when voting and she worries future anti-Israel protesters could be emboldened and get out of hand under Mamdani. “It didn’t make sense to me why he was just getting stronger, and getting more supporters, but then I realized that’s really what is going on in New York right now — it’s really frightening that the voice of the city now is his supporters,” she said. ‘It’s going to be a lot worse to run a business’ Richie Romero owns four sushi bars in the city and says costs are already too high for most business owners to turn a profit. “You walk down the street, and you see all the For Sale signs in the storefronts — people can’t survive,” he told The Post. 16 Richie Romero worries Mamdani’s minimum wage proposals could cause businesses to shut down. Stephen Yang 16 Romero owns several sushi bars around New York City. Stephen Yang “The labor costs are already too high. It’s very hard to do business here currently. It’s going to be a lot worse with him.” Romero, 49, was raised in Queens and now lives in the West Village and feels Mamdani’s socialist agenda is against New York’s hustle. “With socialism, eventually you run out of other people’s money. That’s the simple fact. It kills what makes New York, New York. “It’s like running for middle school president and promising pizza parties every day. There’s no accountability, and I’m sick of not having accountability.” Filed under andrew cuomo nyc mayoral election Zohran Mamdani 10/27/25 Read Next Mamdani didn’t tell the whole truth about his hijab-wear...

Robinson, 22, who allegedly shot father-of-two Kirk in the neck while using high-powered rifle rounds inscribed with pro-trans messages, asked to be allowed to wear civilian clothes in court — even before his jury trial. Judge Tony Graf agreed to the request, but denied Robinson’s bid to ditch his shackles in the courtroom, citing the safety of the public and court staff. Charlie Kirk’s accused assassin, Tyler Robinson, asked a judge to allow him to appear in civilian clothes in court. AP “The case has attracted extraordinary public and media attention,” Graf said. “Images of Mr. Robinson in jail clothing are likely to circulate widely and influence prospective jurors. Given the scale of that publicity, the risk of prejudice is significant.” “Mr. Robinson’s right to the presumption of innocence outweighs the minimal inconvenience of permitting civilian attire and Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent,” Graf added. But the judge stopped short of allowing him to be un-cuffed, instead instructing the media not to photograph his restraints or Robinson walking in and out of the courtroom. Explore More Charlie Kirk suspect’s trans lover Lance Twiggs goes missing 6 weeks after political assassination Judge to make ruling on alleged Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson’s civilian clothes request after tense closed-door hearing Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin wants out of shackles, prison garb in court — as lawyers cite Idaho killer Bryan Kohberger Robinson appeared from jail and was not shown in the brief video hearing. He only spoke once to answer the judge when asked if he could hear him. “Yes, I can,” Robinson responded, his voice hoarse. The Utah native’s lawyer argued in an Oct. 9 motion that if he continues to wear jail clothes and shackles during court hearings future jurors could be prejudiced against him. The lawyer also noted that he was captured during a video hearing wearing a suicide-prevention vest from inside jail which unfairly led to “endless scrutiny and speculation,” the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Utah prosecutors responded in sealed court papers, co-authored with the Utah County Sheriff’s Office, claiming the filing had “secure information that might endanger personal and public safety if disclosed.” Accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Mangione previously made a similar bid to be allowed to ditch a bulletproof vest and handcuffs on the grounds it made him unfairly appear to be extraordinarily dangerous. Prosecutors argued in his case that he shouldn’t be allowed special treatment. The judge didn’t rule on that but Mangione was in jail clothes and handcuffed at his last hearing. He wasn’t wearing a bullet proof vest at that hearing. Robinson is accused of fatally shooting conservative firebrand, Kirk, on Sept. 10. via REUTERS Criminal defendants are usually allowed to appear in civilian clothing during trial so that jurors won’t prejudicially judge their guilt based on jail clothing. Robinson is charged with fatally gunning down conservative firebrand and Turning Point USA founder Kirk, 31, during a speaking engagement at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Robinson is charged with aggravated murder and related crimes. He hasn’t entered a plea yet in the case. Robinson could face the death by firing squad if convicted, as Utah is one of five states that allows that capital punishment method. Trump, who was close friends with Kirk, said he supports that penalty for Robinson. Robinson is due back in court on Jan. 16.

It’s a major shift for Qualcomm, which has long focused on manufacturing semiconductors for wireless activity and mobile phones – not for the power-hungry data centers that are powering the AI boom. Shares in Qualcomm jumped 11% Monday to close at $187.68. Qualcomm — headed by Brazilian-born CEO Cristiano Amon — said its new, super-powered chips will be available in liquid-cooled server racks, which help customers like cloud service providers save on operational costs. 3 Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon speaks during an AI event in March. Getty Images for Qualcomm Nvidia and AMD also sell their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems. Large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT rely on these powerful systems.

Nvidia already dominates about 90% of the data center market and boasts a massive $4.6 trillion market cap. Nvidia’s chips were used to train OpenAI’s ChatGPT, still widely viewed as the most popular AI chatbot. But earlier this month, OpenAI broadened its supply chain. It announced plans to start buying chips from rival AMD, and even potentially take a stake in the company. The AI race has shown no signs of slowing down. Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on AI infrastructure through 2030, according to a McKinsey estimate. 3 Qualcomm’s new AI200 and AI250 chips will go on sale in 2026 and 2027, respectively. REUTERS Qualcomm’s new AI200 and AI250 chips will go on sale in 2026 and 2027, respectively, the company said in a press release. A rack will require 160 kilowatts of power, similar to rack solutions from Nvidia. Qualcomm’s chip-based accelerator cards will support 768 gigabytes of memory – more than comparable options from Nvidia and AMD. The company declined to comment on the price of its AI chips, cards or racks. “Qualcomm AI200 and AI250 are designed for frictionless adoption and rapid innovation,” Durga Malladi, the firm’s senior vice president and general manager for technology planning, said in a statement Monday. 3 Jensen Huang’s Nvidia already dominates about 90% of the data center market. REUTERS “Our rich software stack and open ecosystem support make it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to integrate, manage, and scale already trained AI models on our optimized AI inference solutions.” Qualcomm’s new AI chips will be based on its Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs, which are used for its smartphone chips. The company aims to sell its new chips and other parts separately, so customers can design their own racks if they’d like. Nvidia or AMD could even become potential clients for some data center parts, Malladi told reporters last week. “What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, ‘I’m going to mix and match,’” he said.

He was 78. The Raiders said Atkinson’s family informed the team of his death on Monday. The team said he died in Georgia without revealing his cause of death. The Raiders called Atkinson the anchor of the team’s “Soul Patrol” secondary of the 1970s that helped lead the franchise to its first Super Bowl title. Atkinson remained connected to the organization until his death. George Atkinson, who starred for the Raiders’ “Soul Patrol” secondary in the ’70s, has died at age 78. Getty Images “George’s contributions as a friend and mentor to everyone in the Raiders organization continued long after his playing career, and his genuine personality and wonderful sense of humor will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him,” the team said in a statement. Atkinson played 144 games in his career, spending 10 seasons with the Oakland Raiders and a final season with the Denver Broncos. He played in seven AFL or AFC championship games and helped the Raiders win the Super Bowl following the 1976 season. His 33 career interceptions in the regular season and playoffs rank fourth all-time for the Raiders but he was most known for his physical play.

Atkinson joined the Raiders after being drafted in the seventh round in 1968. He was part of a stellar draft class that included Hall of Famers Ken Stabler and Art Shell, as well as running backs Marv Hubbard and Charlie Smith, who all helped build the team into one of the top clubs in the league in the 1970s. “We became part of the nucleus for the Raiders from that draft,” Atkinson once told the team website. “We wore the Silver and Black with pride. We understood what the tradition was and what we had to live up to.” George Atkinson at a Raiders game in December 2024. Getty Images Atkinson was a major part of that, almost from the start, scoring on an 86-yard punt return in his professional debut. He made the AFL Pro Bowl in his first two seasons for his play as a returner and defensive back and later became part of the most feared safety duo in the NFL after Jack Tatum was drafted in the first round in 1971. In an era when receivers had little or no protection when going over the middle, Atkinson and Tatum doled out harsh punishment to anyone who tried. “We never go out on the field with the intention of trying to hurt anyone but we go out with intentions of getting our jobs done,” Atkinson said at the time. “If you don’t want to get hit, it’s best not to show up when we play Sunday. I guarantee you will get hit.” Atkinson’s most famous hits came against Pittsburgh and Hall of Fame receiver Lynn Swann. He knocked him out in the 1975 AFC championship game and then again in the 1976 season opener with a forearm to the back of the head on a play when Swann didn’t even get the ball. “Maybe a little outside of the rules but that was George’s way of setting the tone for the game,” Stabler later said in an interview with NFL Films. The second hit on Swann led Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll to refer to Atkinson as part of the “criminal element” in the NFL. Atkinson sued Noll for defamation but lost the suit. Atkinson’s twin sons, George III and Josh, both played football at Notre Dame with George Atkinson III having a brief NFL career that included a stint with the Raiders. Josh died by suicide in 2018 and George III died by suicide in 2019. Filed under las vegas raiders obituaries 10/27/25 Read Next Monday Night Football: How to watch Commanders vs. Chiefs ...

After being spotted talking with the “Dune” director and former Bond girl Ana de Armas at the Toronto Film Festival last year, Sweeney was a guest at Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s Venice wedding in June. The “White Lotus” alum, meanwhile, would join the ranks of Armas, Léa Seydoux and Halle Berry if she stars as a Bond girl in the upcoming 007 flick.

The socialist mayoral front-runner made the revelation during a press conference Monday after critics seized on his story, sharing photos on social media of a woman they identified as his aunt, who was pictured without a hijab. “I was speaking about Zehra fuhi, my father’s cousin, who passed away a few years ago,” Mamdani told reporters about the relative, whom he said he affectionately called his aunt. 4 Zohran Mamdani claimed his “aunt” was afraid to ride NYC’s subway after 9/11. Fuhi means paternal aunt in Urdu and Hindi. Mamdani’s campaign did not provide the cousin’s full name, when asked.

Internet sleuths later claimed that a public health consultant, Masuma Mamdani, was the Democratic nominee’s only aunt, posting photos of her in which she appeared without a hijab and noting that she lived in Tanzania on 9/11. Asked about the posts on Monday, Mamdani was prompted to do some damage control and clarify he wasn’t referring to a biological aunt. 4 Mamdani had to clarify that he was referring to his dad’s cousin, not his aunt, in his story about 9/11. “For the takeaway from my more than 10-minute address about Islamophobia in this race and in this city, to be the question of my aunt, tells you everything you need to know about Cuomo and his inability to reckon with a crisis of his own making,” he said.

What our Post expert thinks about Commanders vs. Chiefs The Chiefs would have been the biggest favorites of the week if not for the Indianapolis Colts, who were 15-point favorites at home against the Tennessee Titans. Andy Reid and Kansas City have been rolling over teams the past two weeks. They shut out the Las Vegas Raiders 31-0 and trampled the Detroit Lions 31-17 in consecutive contests. For the Commanders, Marcus Mariota will get the start in place of Daniels this week. Mariota filled in for Daniels twice this season and was 2-1 straight up and against the spread in those games.

Marcus Mariota is set to make his third start for the Commanders tonight; in two prior starts, he is 1-1 with a 60.3% completion percentage for 426 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. The Commanders will also get some offensive help from both Terry McLaurin and Deebo Samuel, who return after missing time due to injury. They’ll face off with a Chiefs team who finally found their groove after starting the season 0-2. Kansas City has won three of their last four, including a 31-0 shutout win against the Raiders in Week 7.

Voters 50 and up accounted for nearly 60% of ballots cast during the first two days of early voting in the city’s mayoral election, data shows. The early flood of ballots cast by Gen Xers, Baby Boomers and the oldest New Yorkers — first reported by Gothamist — is likely far more helpful to ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a moderate looking to keep the 34-year-old socialist Mamdani out of City Hall, said Stephen Graves, president of Gotham Polling. 3 Voters 50 and up accounted for nearly 60% of early ballots cast so far. Michael Nagle “It is unquestionable that the higher the turnout the more it favors Cuomo,” he said. “The more the turnout, you pick up more people who are non-partisan and aren’t super-engaged and that favors the middle.” Explore More Obama’s vulgar reaction to Nancy Pelosi’s ‘surprise’ endorsement of Kamala Harris revealed Biden autopen executive orders should be void — as elderly prez\u0027s actions were ‘not all his own’ after health cover-up: report Mamdani didn’t tell the whole truth about his hijab-wearing \u0027aunt\u0027 who feared for safety post-9/11 Roughly 164,000 voters hit polling sites Saturday and Sunday, with voters aged 50 and up accounting for 95,000 of those ballots, city Board of Election data shows. The turnout so far has drastically outpaced the nearly 67,000 votes cast during the June Democratic primary’s first two days. Mamdani, during that contest, rode a wave of enthusiasm among younger voters to shockingly clinch the Democratic nomination, walloping Cuomo, who is now running as an independent. But Graves said while Mamdani seems a lock to win again among young voters, his overall support isn’t particularly deep. “The reality is Mamdani has very deep support in the young, but it’s not very broad, whereas Cuomo has deep support in the 50-plus and they tend to show up the most,” he said. 3 Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary amid surge of youth voters. Luiz C. Ribeiro for New York Post Nearly 19,000 independents also voted early, with 10,000 of those being in the 50-plus Cuomo sweet spot, the data reveals. Democratic New Yorkers overall cast 121,000 early ballots compared to 10,000 by Republicans, the numbers shows. The Upper East and West sides’ 12th congressional district – a potential Cuomo stronghold – led the turnout with nearly 30,000 votes, according to the data. Another 18,000 votes came from the 11th congressional district, covering all of conservative Staten Island and a sliver of southwest Brooklyn. But the votes in those traditional Cuomo or conservative strongholds could be slightly offset by the 18,000 votes cast in the 10th congressional district, which covers lower Manhattan and Mamdani-loving lefty Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Park Slope. Evan Roth Smith, a pollster at Slingshot Strategies, cautioned that the turnout numbers weren’t that unusual for a general election. “We have returned to form for the age breakdown when the older voters make up the main bloc of voters and in the areas where you expect it to turn out, like the Upper East and West Side and brownstone Brooklyn,” he said. “If you are the Cuomo team, this is what you need to avoid looking like a dead duck. I wouldn’t go as far as to say it favors Cuomo. The 12th congressional district was basically break-even (for Cuomo in the primary). There’s not really enough to say he’s getting the vote he’s looking for, but not enough to say Mamdani has this sewn up.” Here are some highlights from the final 2025 NYC mayoral debate The 5 most notable moments from the final NYC mayoral debate Andrew Cuomo skewers Zohran Mamdani on ‘freeze the rent’ policy in fiery NYC mayoral debate moment: ‘Political blather’ Andrew Cuomo mocks Zohran Mamdani over anti-Israel stance during NYC mayoral debate: ‘You are the savior of the Jewish people?’ Andrew Cuomo declares Trump will knock Zohran Mamdani on his ‘tuchus’ if he’s elected NYC mayor Cuomo, who is running as an independent, could also be handicapped by the presence of GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, Graves said. The consistently third-place-polling Sliwa has defiantly resisted calls to step aside in the general election to give the second-place Cuomo a better shot at toppling Mamdani. “What we don’t know really how many of Curtis’ voters decide that he can’t win so they are not going to waste their vote and vote for Cuomo, who they don’t like,” he said. “There are a lot of Cuomo voters not voting for Cuomo, but against Mamdani.” Bigwig New York City Republican John Catsimatidis — Sliwa’s longtime friend and his boss at WABC radio who has urged him to drop out, to no avail — cast his ballot for Cuomo on the third day of early voting Monday. “I voted for Cuomo because in a city that’s 70% Democrat, he’s the only Democrat in the race,” Catsimatidis, 77, told The Post from his Upper East Side polling place, joined by ex. Gov. David Paterson, who also cast his ballot for Cuomo. 3 Roughly 164,000 voters cast ballot early Saturday and Sunday. Michael Nigro for NY Post “The other guy [Mamdani] is a socialist,” Catsimatidis said. Nearly 80% of undecided voters in the election fall into the 50-plus category, a recent AARP poll found. Turnout for New York City’s mayoral elections tends to be roughly 1.1 million voters, Graves said — forecasting that this contest will draw up to 1.7 million voters. While more turnout could mean more Cuomo votes, Graves said it’s unclear how high it would have to be to get enough independents out to make the race close between the ex-gov and the democratic socialist Mamdani. “But I do know if we get to 1.6 to 1.8 (million) it will help,” he said. Roth Smith said a key indicator will be whether or not the momentum of voter turnout from the weekend continues into the week, when there’s traditionally a drop off in voting patterns as New Yorkers contend with work. “If there is less of a cliff, we can say there’s high motivation in this election whether that’s heavy turnout for Zohran or to prevent Zohran,” he said. During the primary, early voting numbers stayed relatively steady throughout driven by motivated young Democratic voters getting out to the the ballot boxes for Mamdani. The older-voter turnout raised early alarms among some of Mamdani’s backers, notably frequent Cuomo foe state Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens), who deemed it “not a good sign for Zohran.” “In my community, working-class older democrats have organized ‘against socialists,’ and there has been no effort to reach out to them by the left,” he posted on X. “Even though many of them stood with me in fighting against Cuomo in the past, they now stand with him.” Mamdani, when asked about the turnout Monday, highlighted his campaign’s focus on affordability as a message that resonates with seniors. “I think we should always celebrate when more New Yorkers are going to the polls,” he said. “And I continue to be confident in our campaign as well as in our outreach to voters above the age of 55 and also, I will not allow myself to be complacent.” Despite Mamdani’s message of confidence, his campaign later sent a panicky emails to supporters blaring in bold text that the “highest number of early voters so far are in age brackets where Cuomo either ties or leads Zohran in the latest polls.” “Now, though the polls say that we are an inevitability, we cannot let complacency undo the work we’ve done to convince the world that New Yorkers have a right to afford this city that we all love,” the email said. — Additional reporting by Matthew Fischetti Filed under andrew cuomo curtis sliwa NYC Mayoral Election 2025 voting Zohran Mamdani 10/27/25 Read Next NYPD honors 194 for \u0027heroic\u0027 response to Midtown mass shoo...

We may receive revenue from this partnership for sharing this content and/or when you make a purchase. Featured pricing is subject to change. Mind-melding beats won’t be the only thing dropping in Brooklyn this week. When our team last reported on ticket prices to see Tame Impala’s four ‘Deadbeat Tour’ concerts at the Barclays Center — which take place Oct. 27, Oct. 28, Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 — the lowest price we could find for any one show was $129 including fees on Vivid Seats. Now, just six days later, prices are plummeting. At the time of publication, we found tickets going for as low as $87 including fees on Vivid Seats for the quartet of gigs. Other shows have seats starting anywhere from $91 to $142 including fees. Sometimes when you “Let It Happen” and wait until the last minute to buy tickets, things work out in your favor. Should you attend in Brooklyn, you’ll be at the first four concerts of Tame Impala’s 2025-26 international trek. They come in support of his recently-released fifth studio album that shares a new with the run. On the record, Tame Impala — aka Kevin Parker — “explores ‘new and scary’ worlds of thumping club tracks, driving RnB influences and grooving nu-disco” according to ABC.net. “The bones of a Tame Impala record is still there, just with a far wider wardrobe of outfits to try on.” And, while we can’t say for certain what he’ll take to the stage at the Nets’ home arena, it’s likely he’ll revisit fan favorites like “The Less I Know The Better,” “Borderline,” “Let It Happen,” “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” and “Eventually” and others along with cuts from “Deadbeat.” The last time Parker headlined at Barclays Center was in March 2022 on his ‘Slow Rush Tour.’ “Walking out, several members of the surprisingly young crowd — a demographic that’s dutifully posted the band’s songs on TikTok — were excitedly chatting about how that was ‘the best concert I’ve ever been to’ and ‘I would go see them again and again,\u0027” Variety reported after attending one of the gigs. Want to be at what just might be one of best concerts you ever go to for less? You’re in the right place, Disciples.

Based on our findings at Set List FM, here’s what the group performed on the second of their two-night Brooklyn stay. 01) “One More Year” 02.) “Borderline” 03.) “Nangs” 04.) “The Moment” 05.) “Breathe Deeper” 06.) “On Track” 07.) “Elephant” 08.) “Lost in Yesterday” 09.) “Apocalypse Dreams” 10.) “Let It Happen” 11.) “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards” 12.) “Is It True” 13.) “Glimmer” 14.) “Eventually” 15.) “Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control” 16.) “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” Encore 17.) “The Less I Know the Better” 18.) “One More Hour” Tame Impala new music On Friday, Oct. 17, Tame Impala dropped their fifth studio album “Deadbeat.” Although reviews have been unkind, there’s a lot to like from this 12-track offering that’s more lively dance party than introspective psych rock. Things get underway with the lo-fi piano “My Old Ways.” The quiet ditty seems like an odd choice to kick off the record until the beat drops a minute in and the song builds to a hypnotic higher plane. The tune is light as air and impossible not to nod along to. The group maintains that feel-good frequency on the laid-back yet urgent “No Reply” (our only note is that we could have done without the wince-inducing lyric “you’re a cinephile, I watch ‘Family Guy\u0027”), self-assured “Thriller”-esque “Dracula” and funky “Loser,” which is full of introspective lyrics and trippy tropical instrumentals. Other highlights include the thumping, intimate bop “Not My World” (we’ve dubbed the song “half-ballad, half-banger”), dreamy, synth-y “Piece of Heaven” and strummy crowd-pleaser “Obsolete.” Make sure to stick around until the bitter end too. There you’ll find the final track, the jittery, breakbeat “End of Summer,” which is a hypnotic epic that toes the line of indie rock, EDM, pop and full-on stadium anthem. It’s groovy, mean, lean and a heckuva good time. If you’d like to form your own opinion, you can find “Deadbeat” here. Huge rockers on tour in 2025-26 If you want to rock out this year (and next), you’re in luck. Here are five of our favorite artists that share a bit of DNA with Tame Impala and also happen to be dusting off their hits and deep cuts these next few months. • Robert Plant • RUSH • The Hives • Nine Inch Nails • David Byrne Plus, Queens of the Stone Age is midway through an exciting acoustic tour as well.

James Keivom The top cop handed out “excellent police duty” awards to 188 responding officers, and “meritorious police duty” awards to six who were lauded for “valuable police service demonstrating special faithfulness or perseverance, or highly credible acts of police service over a period of time.” The tragic shooting rocked the city. Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas casino security guard, walked into the 44-story building with an assault rifle around 6:30 p.m. and opened fire in the lobby, mortally wounding Islam, 36, a married veteran cop. He then turned the weapon on Wesley LePatner, a 43-year-old executive with Blackstone and a married mom of two, and security guard Aland Etienne, 46, who sought refuge behind a desk, killing them both before heading to the elevators. Police said the maniac, who had a history of mental health issues. was targeting the National Football League, which has offices in the building, over a perceived injury from playing high school ball. 6 An NYPD sergeant pays respect to the family of fallen cop Didarul Islam at an awards ceremony at 1 Police Plaza.

Cops said Tamura also fired at cleaning woman Sebije Nelovic, who managed to duck into a closet and survived, before turning the gun on himself — falling where police later found him dead. Islam, the first casualty of the horror, was posthumously promoted to the rank of detective. “Detective Islam with the embodiment of quiet strength,” Tisch said at Monday’s awards ceremony. “He did not seek recognition. He did not raise his voice.

In late September. But it wasn’t because of premature Canadian frost and exuberant holiday cheer. No, a Christmas movie was being filmed in the lovely town that boasts exceptional Shakespeare stagings, modern plays and musicals about 90 minutes from Toronto. “Merry Christmas!,” a restaurant server greeted me with. Oh, Canada. 9 Harper Rae Asch stars at the title orphan with a heart of gold in “Annie” at the Stratford Festival. Ann Baggley During this unusually long season at the 72-year-old theatrical institution, though, audiences will likely witness some actual flurries eventually. More From Johnny Oleksinski Can Johnny Depp really make a Hollywood comeback? Fallen star in talks for first major studio film in years ‘A House of Dynamite’ review: A realistic nuclear war is turned into a cheesy disaster flick Sorry, Netflix — ‘Kennedy’ is not going to be your new ‘The Crown’ The venerable festival’s revival of “Annie” plays well into December — one of spring-and-summer Stratford’s longest runs ever. So the sun will come out tomorrow, albeit for fewer hours. Directed by Donna Feore, Stratford’s queen of musicals, the jaunty production that runs till Dec. 14 finds a winning balance of nostalgia and novelty. Today’s kids continue to have a hankering for go-get-em Annie (a guileless Harper Rae Asch) and her hard-knock life, but they have no clue it ever was a comic strip. Or, for that matter, what a comic strip even is. Every revival has to contend with the fact that the rags-to-riches plot, more outlandish by the year, is foundationally two-dimensional. Feore’s likable version smartly straddles a comfortable middle ground. The often cartoony costumes and wigs are more realistic and worn-out; less cherry Starburst. Yet it’s importantly not as glum as some recent revivals of Charles Strouse, Thomas Meehan and Martin Charnin’s show have been. How can it be? With Macy’s Parade-balloon-sized characters like the evil Miss Hannigan — played with last-call bitterness by Laura Condlin — Daddy Warbucks (master of disguise, Dan Chameroy) and a deus ex machina in the form of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, you can’t very well treat wholesome “Annie” like it’s “Anna Karenina.” 9 It’s like you’ve stumbled into a gymnastics meet — with singing. David Hou Feore, who showed in the festival’s “Billy Elliot” and “The Sound of Music” that she’s a wiz with kids, cranks up the spirit with a sensational ensemble of young actors as the orphans. It’s like you’ve stumbled into a gymnastics meet with singing — Backflips: The Musical! The girls are all budding comedians, too. There is, of course, a risk in performing “Annie” on Stratford’s thrust Festival Theatre stage. Dog lovers, dangerously close to the action, will want to run up and steal the adorable, shaggy pups who play stray Sandy. A fifteen-minute walk away, there are another couple of dogs in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,” the deliriously funny musical comedy playing at the Avon Theatre through Nov. 23. Only they’re human: Lawrence Jameson and Freddy Benson, the sleazy dueling con artists who were played in the movie by Michael Caine and Steve Martin. Lawrence is a snaky Brit in a smart suit worn by the cracking actor Jonathan Goad, who’s a pro at being both dapper and shady. And Freddy is the boyish young upstart invading his turf. They’re trying to trick the same woman in the south of France. 9 Stratford’s revival of “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” is a hilarious musical comedy. David Hou Freddy is usually played by Liam Tobin, but I saw his understudy Henry Firmston. I’d watched the actor once before in the festival’s “Something Rotten” (returning next year) last season. His unique, puckish energy — more rerun of “Friends” than “step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch” — really punches up every show he’s a part of. Hysterical toe-tappers from composer David Yazbek, such as “Great Big Stuff” and “Ruprect,” made my abs feel like they’d just been put through sit-ups. The musicals presented in the proscenium Avon have visually gone a step down in recent years. That’s still true of “Dirty Rotten,” directed by Tracey Flye. The scenery is basic and a little flat. When it comes to belly laughs, however: great big stuff. 9 Liam Tobin and Jonathan Goad star as Freddy and Lawrence in “Rotten.” David Hou This season, the spectacle in that theater has instead been handed to power-hungry, stab-happy Mr. “Macbeth.” In Robert Lepage’s gas-giant version of Shakespeare’s tragedy, on through Nov. 22, you’ll get eye of newt and toe of frog, Motel Six and gangs on hogs. Yes, the director — whose work New York audiences will know from the Met’s “Ring Cycle” in 2010 — has turned Mackers, Lady M, Banquo and the rest into grungy bikers. Hells MacAngels. Aesthetically, it’s as exciting as any play you’ll see on Broadway. Lately, quite a bit more so. A massive highway motel rotates with devious mischief — bloody murders, disrobing — happening in multiple rooms. Motorcycles roll across the stage. And two-way mirrors are used to spooky effect. As far as the power structures and ground rules of the warring factions go, however, something baffling this way comes. 9 Robert Lepage has reimagined “Macbeth” as a biker-gang tragedy. David Hou “Macbeth” is always a tricky tragedy. Ambition, witchcraft and defiance of the natural order (killing a king) are all fused into one very complicated dude. Leather jackets and doo-rags blur the situation more than contribute anything substantive. And the concept of the witches feels particularly unserious. Lepage’s flair for reinvention worked far better when he moved the action of “Corilanus” to a recognizable Washington DC a few years back. The “House of Cards” political-thriller mood gave audiences a way into that play that “Macbeth” doesn’t especially shout out for. That said: As far as Macbeths and Lady Macbeths go, you can’t do much better than Tom McCamus, with the voice of a midnight radio host and the scowl of a brutal killer, and Lucy Peacock, whose electrified Lady M takes particular delight in destruction. Maybe even more ambitious than that climbing couple was one of the hotter tickets I saw — “Forgiveness,” an emotional and expansive new play at the Tom Patterson Theatre about the plight of Japanese-Canadians during World War II that covers four decades. 9 The set includes a giant spinning motel, and motorcycles are driven across the stage. David Hou It begins in 1968, with Mitsue’s son bringing home his girlfriend’s mother Phyllis (Jacklyn Francis) and father, Ralph, for dinner. The usual concerns about sweethearts’ folks meeting for the first time — what to make, what to wear — are compounded by the ‘rents’ traumatic histories, which painfully unfold as we rewind to the 1930s. Mitsue (Yoshie Bancroft, empathic and wonderful) and her family experience racism in Vancouver and eventually are put in an internment camp after the attack on Pearl Harbor. At the same time, Ralph (Jeff Lillico, a flesh-and-blood time capsule) fights overseas for Canada and becomes one of Japan’s prisoners of war. In the end comes an affirming and deeply moving mutual understanding that suggests that an opportunity to heal is always on the table. Based on Mark Sakamoto’s memoir, playwright Hiro Kanagawa occasionally overloads the dialogue with cliches and lofty phrasing. But, on the whole, “Forgiveness” is an impressive feat. The huge number of locales and events are deftly woven together, and staged with sweep and intimacy by Stafford Arima. 9 A new play called “Forgiveness” spans four decades in the lives of two Canadian families. David Hou Family drama and the long passage of time also power the festival’s best show of the 2025 roster, Shakespeare’s “The Winter’s Tale,” directed by Antoni Cimolino. The superb romance exemplifies why I don’t know how to quit Stratford, where I’ve been schlepping to for 18 years. The must-sees are often quirky — a “Winter’s Tale” or a “Cymbeline,” rather than a “Hamlet” or “Romeo and Juliet.” And the company routinely does the Bard better than any theater in New York so much as approaches, certainly including the Public’s Shakespeare in the Park so-so productions of late. Graham Abbey’s King Leontes, a brilliant piece of casting, ranks with the finest Shakespearean performances I’ve enjoyed anywhere. As the jolly actor’s natural gregariousness peels away to reveal his character’s twisted and unfounded jealousy of his wife Hermione (Sara Topham) and best friend Polixenes (André Sills), the rapt audience stares on disgusted and devastated. I suspect more than a few relate. 9 “The Winter’s Tale” is as fine a Shakespeare production as you’ll ever see. David Hou Leontes alone implodes the lives of himself, his pregnant wife and his poor young little son Mammillus over a hot-blooded hunch. What’s strange and lovable — foul and fair, if you like — about “The Winter’s Tale” is that much of the second half, 16 years after those royal horrors, is a delightful romp. There’s spritely dancing and a pair of fabulous clowns — feisty favorite Geraint Wyn Davies as Autolycus and zany Christo Graham as the Young Shepard. Graham, by the way, is Alfredo from Pixar’s “Ratatouille” come to life. Don’t be totally fooled by the mirth. The final scene between Hermione, Leontes and Yanna McIntosh’s excellent Paulina is more heartbreaking and heartwarming than you have ever seen it before. 9 “The Winter’s Tale” was Stratford’s best show of the 2025 season. David Hou. And then, just when we think Leontes has earned a second chance in old age, Abbey and Cimolino powerfully remind us that some choices cannot be undone. This extraordinary “Winter’s Tale” is a combo of tragedy and euphoria in more ways than one. How tragic that it’s already closed! And how happy that it’s been professionally filmed for a theatrical release and eventual streaming. Meanwhile, there are plenty of shows to catch before the season’s end — even if you might exit, pursued by a blizzard.

The Washington Commanders and Kansas City Chiefs will close out Week 8 of the NFL season on “Monday Night Football” at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs have been rolling lately with back-to-back huge wins, and the Commanders are reeling after back-to-back losses and the loss of their best player. Those factors combined have pushed this spread to -10.5 for the Chiefs ahead of Monday’s primetime game. Commanders vs. Chiefs odds, prediction The injury to Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels may have dampened the excitement for one side of this matchup, but there’s plenty to be excited about on the Chiefs’ side of things.

The two-time MVP has 11 passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns over the past four games, and their three wins in that span have been by a margin of 17 points against the Ravens, 13 points against the Lions, and 31 points against the Raiders. Mahomes has all of his receivers healthy and available now that Rashee Rice has returned to the field. Xavier Worthy, who is always a threat for a huge play, seems to be getting healthy as well and was a full participant at practice as he nurses an ankle and shoulder injury. The Chiefs won’t have lineman Josh Simmons, who remains away from the team for a family matter and Trey Smith is doubtful with back spasms, but this team has weathered every challenge so far this season.

Read our expert guide on how to bet on the NFL Check out the best NFL betting sites Get the BetMGM Bonus Code Entering the week, Washington’s passing defense ranked at or near the bottom in a number of categories. They allow the most passing yards gained per completion in the NFL (13.0) and the eighth-most passing yards gained per game (238.3). Their defense hasn’t been able to stop the run either. The Commanders rank 20th in rushing yards allowed per game (126.0) and the defense has given up 400-plus total yards three times in seven games this season. They will be catching the Chiefs as they are hitting their stride and it could end up being a long night for the Washington defense. The Chiefs are beating teams by an average of 14.5 points at home — slightly inflated after the Raiders blowout — but I have no interest in betting them to cover a double-digit spread. I do think we’ll see another big game from Mahomes, though. He’s averaging 282.8 passing yards per game over his past four games, but his prop is listed as low as 271.5. He has topped that number twice in that four-game span and came just two yards short of that mark against the Ravens. I expect him to carve up the Commanders Monday night and hit the over on this prop.

Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post The New York millennial was bled dry earlier this year by a group of scammers who used phone number-spoofing technology — software used to misleadingly alter caller ID information — to empty his bank account, taking all of his life savings, totaling nearly $30,000. “It’s devastating,” Phillips, 33, a journalist and an NYC transplant from London, exclusively told The Post. “I can still hear the voices of the people who called me, posing as employees of Chase Bank, claiming there had been fraudulent activity on my account.” “They used fear tactics to basically hypnotize me into handing over all the money I’d worked so hard to earn and save over the last four years,” he added. Deborah Moss, a 65-year-old caterer from Northern California, was previously thunderstruck by a similar wave of devastation when an imposter targeted her, draining her Chase account of a shocking $162,000 in 2020.

That was all my money.” 12 Phillips, who’d just quit his job before being scammed out of his life savings, says he’s desperately tried to track down the fraudsters. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post That’s the sinister trickery of business imposter scams, which have been on a steady rise, outpacing romance scams, family and friend scams and tech support scams over the past five years. The crime now ranks as the No.1 consumer complaint of 2025, per data provided to The Post by the Federal Trade Commission. As of late June, the FTC, which protects folks from deceptive and unjust business practices, has been inundated with over 516,000 imposter scam complaints — totaling almost $1.7 million in losses. See Also NYC granny loses life savings to online scam — and she’s placing the blame on banks: lawsuit To get their paws on a target’s money, imposter scammers often call — or email, text or direct message — a victim, pretending to be a representative from a trusted, established company. They typically claim that there’s been some sort of privacy breach or unauthorized dealings on their account. After spinning a falsified yarn about an alleged faux pas, the wolves in sheep’s clothing create a sense of urgency and panic about the situation, convincing their prey to hastily transfer large sums of money or divulge personal information to avoid any further malfeasance. But in reality, they’re the bad guys, siphoning cash and info for their own greedy gain. And imposter scammers don’t limit their villainy to masquerading as reps for financial institutions like Bank of America or TD Bank — just two of the corporations that Upper East Side granny Nina Mortellito, 86, is suing in New York state court, alleging they failed to protect her from a $700,000 con. In August 2023, she was allegedly targeted via a pop-up window that falsely warned that her bank accounts were about to be hacked, according to a lawsuit filed earlier this month. Over the course of nine months, Mortellito, who suffers from age-related memory issues, was allegedly convinced by fraudsters to make a series of unusual withdrawals, totaling anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, from Merrill Lynch, TD Bank and UBS accounts, according to court papers. Although the banks were aware she was vulnerable to scammers, they didn’t raise any alarms, the lawsuit charged. The Post has reached out to Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, TD Bank and UBS for comment. Robert Georges, Mortellito’s attorney, told The Post he’s inundated with bank imposter fraud cases from victims plagued with “devastation, embarrassment, confusion and upset” following the violation. “There’s this fear about how they’re going to live without their life savings,” he added. “This is a well-known epidemic in America. All the banks are aware that this is a major problem, but we don’t feel that banks are doing a reasonable job to protect people. We’re bringing these lawsuits to hopefully effect change.” Mortellito and her lawyer are seeking unspecified damages against the banks, whom they’re suing for negligence, The Post previously reported. 12 Business imposter scams have risen steadily over the past five years. 2B – stock.adobe.com In addition to impersonating bankers in the name of fraud, ne’er-do-wells also commonly pose as customer service staffers for popular retailers, delivery service couriers or utility company workers, just to name a few. Christopher Brown, a lawyer with the FTC’s Division of Marketing Practices, calls the swindles “sophisticated” and credits the prevalence of artificial intelligence with helping fraudsters seem legitimate. “AI can certainly amplify the scams, making them more believable,” Brown told The Post, noting the multitude of AI-powered spoofing and voice-hijacking tools available to perps. “They’re trying to gain your trust, making you believe they are who they’re claiming to be.” The Federal Communications Commission reports that US consumers receive approximately 4 billion spoofed calls, including automated robocalls, from money-hungry scammers each month. To combat the crisis, the FCC recently implemented its STIR/SHAKEN framework. It’s an industry-standard caller ID authentication technology that validates the legitimacy of calls, allowing the phone company of the receiver to verify that a call is, in fact, from the number displayed on the caller ID. Still, tech-savvy scoundrels manage to circumvent the blocks. Brown encourages folks to remain vigilant. “Don’t [automatically] trust the caller ID because it might be spoofed,” he said. “And you should not provide financial information to someone who calls you out of the blue.” It’s a mistake Phillips, who lives in East New York, wishes he could undo. 12 Believing that the spoofed call was legitimate, Phillips followed the scammers’ orders, transferring money into the “hidden decoy accounts” that the impostors claimed they’d set up in his name. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post Just seconds before getting a phone call from would-be wrongdoers, he’d received an alert from his Chase app, claiming an unauthorized transaction of $500 had been withdrawn from his account. “The timing of the call was immaculate,” said Phillips. “After they explained that my account had [been hacked], I immediately asked, ‘Well, how do I know you’re Chase Bank?’ Then I hung up, Googled the number for Chase, and it was the same number that had called me.” But the thieves had spoofed the bank’s phone number and immediately called back from it. He answered — and that would ultimately change his life for the worse. 12 The Brooklynite remembers talking to at least five different people pretending to be bank staffers and law enforcement agents. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post “They proceeded to tell me that my account was under attack, and that they suspected employees at my local branch had stolen my personal details,” he recalled. “They said they’d launched an investigation, and that I needed to move my money into a hidden or ‘decoy’ account that already had my name on it.” Phillips began panicking. There wasn’t just one voice scaring him into submission — there were at least five, even people posting as law enforcement. “There was the ambient sounds of a call center,” added Phillips, now realizing the background faux noise was likely an AI sound effect tool. “And everyone had solid American accents,” remembered the Brit. “So I’m thinking, ‘OK, this is not the typical call from abroad. This is legitimate.’” 12 The “devastating” realization that he’d just fallen victim to an imposter fraud was almost too difficult for Phillips to bear. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post After being transferred from one hustler to another, Phillips was instructed to go to his local Chase branch and transfer his money into several “decoy” accounts they’d created, instructing him not to disclose to any bank employees the reason for doing so. The scammers “were very good at manipulating me and telling me what to do,” Phillips lamented. “While at the bank, I secretly had them listening to everything that was happening through my ear pods.” It wasn’t until the final dollars of his $30K nest egg — cash he’d stashed for extended getaways to Thailand and England — were transferred that Phillips realized he’d been had. It was an agonizing aha moment. “I remember feeling so wounded,” said Phillips. “My entire world just came crashing down within the few minutes it took to walk into the bank. I was completely devastated.” 12 Deborah Moss tells The Post that she spent over a decade saving money in order to purchase a new house and do home renovations. photo by Chris Hardy California-based victim Moss was targeted by a fraudster who referred to herself as “Miss Barbara,” a rep for the bank, who called claiming that Moss’ ATM card had been compromised and that she’d be issued a new one in the mail. Miss Barbara, a sweet-sounding Southern belle, already had Moss’ phone number, address and banking information. The chiseler claimed that all she needed from Moss was a three-digit code that she’d received via text from the bank. An unwitting Moss recited the code to Barbara, not realizing that those numbers were actually granting the bilker authorization to make a $32,000 wire transfer from her account. And that was just the first grab. 12 Both the FTC and the FCC warn that business impostors, including bank fraud scammers, are on the rise. NongAsimo – stock.adobe.com Barbara called Moss for more than a week, each time claiming that her ATM card had been lost in the mail, and asking her to read off the new three-digit code she’d been messaged. After more than 10 calls, an admittedly “annoyed” Moss, who’d just relocated to a rural area with her partner, took the 40-minute trip into town to get a new card at a Chase branch. However, instead of a piece of plastic, the entrepreneur was given the shock of her life — and almost no sympathy. “The bank manager pulled up my account and said, ‘There’s no money in your account, whatsoever. As a matter of fact, in the last week, you’ve [accrued a] $989 deficit that you owe us,’” she recalled, alleging that the worker threatened to have her removed from the premises if she didn’t stop screaming. “I went to the cops, and they pretty much laughed in my face,” Moss claimed. “They said, ‘Oh, man, forget it. You’ll never get that money back.’ They didn’t do anything. There was no investigation.” 12 Moss claims she reached out to her bank and the police, as well as local and federal government officials, for help. photo by Chris Hardy Phillips alleges having a similarly unpleasant interaction with the New York Police Department immediately after being victimized. “I remember walking into the police station the same day this happened. I told an officer I’d been scammed out of thousands,” said the London native. “He laughed really loud and said, ‘You’re f—ked.’” “I was in disbelief,” said Phillips, adding that he’s more recently been contacted with an investigator, who allegedly “apologized” for his colleague’s conduct, and mapped out a plan to subpoena Chase for any information regarding the bank’s accounts in which monies were transferred. When contacted by The Post, a spokesperson for the NYPD’s Deputy Commissioner, Public Information provided the following statement: “There is a report on file for grand larceny, within the confines of the 75 Precinct. It was reported to police that on July 21, 2025, at approximately 08:00, a 33-year-old male received a call from an unknown individual claiming to work for Chase Bank who stated to the male that his account was compromised. The victim then transferred approximately $23,700 to two accounts that belonged to unknown individuals. There are no arrests, and the investigation remains ongoing. Anyone who has been the victim of an apparent scam is encouraged to report it to the police so that detectives can conduct a complete and thorough investigation.” 12 Both Phillips and Moss were banking with Chase at the time of the scams, but fraudsters can impersonate almost any company. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post Both Phillips and Moss separately claimed to The Post that Chase also failed to offer them any support toward bringing their respective vandals to justice or recovering their stolen funds. “The bigger injustice than a scammer stealing money is when your bank doesn’t help customers who fall victim to such a crime,” said Phillips, noting that in the UK, financial institutions repay victims of fraud up to £85,000 (approximately $113,000). Financial institutions in the US, however, are generally not required to reimburse victims of bank fraud under federal law, per the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. “In America, the last thing you expect is for your bank to turn its back on you,” he griped, underscoring how “stupid” he’s been made to feel for falling victim to fraud. Phillips is considering taking legal action against Chase. “All my money is gone, and there’s no guarantee that I’ll ever get it back,” he said. A spokesperson for Chase declined to comment on the specifics of either Phillips’ or Moss’ claims. 12 Thanks to her benefactor, Moss has been able to resume life with a renewed sense of trust in people. photo by Chris Hardy However, they did share advice for avoiding similar attacks. “Scammers are increasingly using technology like phone spoofing to impersonate trusted institutions,” the rep told The Post, “which is why we regularly remind everyone your bank will never call and ask for your account information, tell you to transfer money to ‘protect’ it, insist you lie to bankers about a transaction, or pressure you to act immediately.” “If you encounter any of these red flags — whether by phone, text, email or online — hang up and call the number on the back of your card.” ‘All my money is gone, and there’s no guarantee that I’ll ever get it back.’ Noel Phillips The tips would have been helpful to Moss at the time of her violation. But even without them, she miraculously recovered every penny of her stolen funds — no thanks to the bank or law enforcement. The six-figure sum came from a random good Samaritan. “My story made national news, and I got a call from this lady who said, ‘I saw your story on TV, and I want to write you a check for $162,000,’” recalled Moss. “I didn’t know her. It was totally crazy.” The kindly stranger — who Moss chose not to identify for privacy — was an elderly, wealthy woman from Napa County, California. She had no hidden agendas, nor any expectation for reimbursement. She just wanted to do the right thing, says Moss, adding that the check was like manna from heaven that restored her faith in humanity. “[The woman and I] don’t talk much,” she confessed. “But I write her every New Year, telling her she’s changed my life. “And I’ll do that until the day I die.” Here are Chase Bank’s tips for avoiding imposter scams 12 Owing to the prevalence of AI and spoofing technologies, authorities advise people against trusting the numbers on their caller IDs or the voices on the other end of the line. NY Post Design Do not respond to phone, text or internet requests for money or access to your computer or bank accounts. Banks will never call, text or email asking for you to send money to yourself or anyone else to prevent fraud. If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from your bank, the best thing to do is hang up immediately and call your bank at the number on the back of your debit or credit card. A bank will never call and ask you to verify information about your account, but we may need to verify information when you call us. Consider adding a call protector app to your phone to flag calls that are likely scams. Set up a code word with your close circle and always confirm callers by contacting them back on a phone number you know to be theirs. Chase Credit Journey offers free credit and identity monitoring, including alerts to let you know if your personal information is exposed in a data breach or on the dark web. You don’t have to be a Chase customer to use it. The bank also hosts more than 1,000 free, open-to-the-public workshops focused on fraud and scam prevention at branches annually, an average of three per day. If you feel you’ve been scammed, contact your bank to discuss how to best protect your banking information and verify recent transactions to ensure no fraudulent activity on your account.

Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post The New York millennial was bled dry earlier this year by a group of scammers who used phone number-spoofing technology — software used to misleadingly alter caller ID information — to empty his bank account, taking all of his life savings, totaling nearly $30,000. “It’s devastating,” Phillips, 33, a journalist and an NYC transplant from London, exclusively told The Post. “I can still hear the voices of the people who called me, posing as employees of Chase Bank, claiming there had been fraudulent activity on my account.” “They used fear tactics to basically hypnotize me into handing over all the money I’d worked so hard to earn and save over the last four years,” he added. Deborah Moss, a 65-year-old caterer from Northern California, was previously thunderstruck by a similar wave of devastation when an imposter targeted her, draining her Chase account of a shocking $162,000 in 2020.

That was all my money.” 12 Phillips, who’d just quit his job before being scammed out of his life savings, says he’s desperately tried to track down the fraudsters. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post That’s the sinister trickery of business imposter scams, which have been on a steady rise, outpacing romance scams, family and friend scams and tech support scams over the past five years. The crime now ranks as the No.1 consumer complaint of 2025, per data provided to The Post by the Federal Trade Commission. As of late June, the FTC, which protects folks from deceptive and unjust business practices, has been inundated with over 516,000 imposter scam complaints — totaling almost $1.7 million in losses. See Also NYC granny loses life savings to online scam — and she’s placing the blame on banks: lawsuit To get their paws on a target’s money, imposter scammers often call — or email, text or direct message — a victim, pretending to be a representative from a trusted, established company. They typically claim that there’s been some sort of privacy breach or unauthorized dealings on their account. After spinning a falsified yarn about an alleged faux pas, the wolves in sheep’s clothing create a sense of urgency and panic about the situation, convincing their prey to hastily transfer large sums of money or divulge personal information to avoid any further malfeasance. But in reality, they’re the bad guys, siphoning cash and info for their own greedy gain. And imposter scammers don’t limit their villainy to masquerading as reps for financial institutions like Bank of America or TD Bank — just two of the corporations that Upper East Side granny Nina Mortellito, 86, is suing in New York state court, alleging they failed to protect her from a $700,000 con. In August 2023, she was allegedly targeted via a pop-up window that falsely warned that her bank accounts were about to be hacked, according to a lawsuit filed earlier this month. Over the course of nine months, Mortellito, who suffers from age-related memory issues, was allegedly convinced by fraudsters to make a series of unusual withdrawals, totaling anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, from Merrill Lynch, TD Bank and UBS accounts, according to court papers. Although the banks were aware she was vulnerable to scammers, they didn’t raise any alarms, the lawsuit charged. The Post has reached out to Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, TD Bank and UBS for comment. Robert Georges, Mortellito’s attorney, told The Post he’s inundated with bank imposter fraud cases from victims plagued with “devastation, embarrassment, confusion and upset” following the violation. “There’s this fear about how they’re going to live without their life savings,” he added. “This is a well-known epidemic in America. All the banks are aware that this is a major problem, but we don’t feel that banks are doing a reasonable job to protect people. We’re bringing these lawsuits to hopefully effect change.” Mortellito and her lawyer are seeking unspecified damages against the banks, whom they’re suing for negligence, The Post previously reported. 12 Business imposter scams have risen steadily over the past five years. 2B – stock.adobe.com In addition to impersonating bankers in the name of fraud, ne’er-do-wells also commonly pose as customer service staffers for popular retailers, delivery service couriers or utility company workers, just to name a few. Christopher Brown, a lawyer with the FTC’s Division of Marketing Practices, calls the swindles “sophisticated” and credits the prevalence of artificial intelligence with helping fraudsters seem legitimate. “AI can certainly amplify the scams, making them more believable,” Brown told The Post, noting the multitude of AI-powered spoofing and voice-hijacking tools available to perps. “They’re trying to gain your trust, making you believe they are who they’re claiming to be.” The Federal Communications Commission reports that US consumers receive approximately 4 billion spoofed calls, including automated robocalls, from money-hungry scammers each month. To combat the crisis, the FCC recently implemented its STIR/SHAKEN framework. It’s an industry-standard caller ID authentication technology that validates the legitimacy of calls, allowing the phone company of the receiver to verify that a call is, in fact, from the number displayed on the caller ID. Still, tech-savvy scoundrels manage to circumvent the blocks. Brown encourages folks to remain vigilant. “Don’t [automatically] trust the caller ID because it might be spoofed,” he said. “And you should not provide financial information to someone who calls you out of the blue.” It’s a mistake Phillips, who lives in East New York, wishes he could undo. 12 Believing that the spoofed call was legitimate, Phillips followed the scammers’ orders, transferring money into the “hidden decoy accounts” that the impostors claimed they’d set up in his name. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post Just seconds before getting a phone call from would-be wrongdoers, he’d received an alert from his Chase app, claiming an unauthorized transaction of $500 had been withdrawn from his account. “The timing of the call was immaculate,” said Phillips. “After they explained that my account had [been hacked], I immediately asked, ‘Well, how do I know you’re Chase Bank?’ Then I hung up, Googled the number for Chase, and it was the same number that had called me.” But the thieves had spoofed the bank’s phone number and immediately called back from it. He answered — and that would ultimately change his life for the worse. 12 The Brooklynite remembers talking to at least five different people pretending to be bank staffers and law enforcement agents. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post “They proceeded to tell me that my account was under attack, and that they suspected employees at my local branch had stolen my personal details,” he recalled. “They said they’d launched an investigation, and that I needed to move my money into a hidden or ‘decoy’ account that already had my name on it.” Phillips began panicking. There wasn’t just one voice scaring him into submission — there were at least five, even people posting as law enforcement. “There was the ambient sounds of a call center,” added Phillips, now realizing the background faux noise was likely an AI sound effect tool. “And everyone had solid American accents,” remembered the Brit. “So I’m thinking, ‘OK, this is not the typical call from abroad. This is legitimate.’” 12 The “devastating” realization that he’d just fallen victim to an imposter fraud was almost too difficult for Phillips to bear. Tamara Beckwith/N.Y.Post After being transferred from one hustler to another, Phillips was instructed to go to his local Chase branch and transfer his money into several “decoy” accounts they’d created, instructing him not to disclose to any bank employees the reason for doing so. The scammers “were very good at manipulating me and telling me what to do,” Phillips lamented. “While at the bank, I secretly had them listening to everything that was happening through my ear pods.” It wasn’t until the final dollars of his $30K nest egg — cash he’d stashed for extended getaways to Thailand and England — were transferred that Phillips realized he’d been had. It was an agonizing aha moment. “I remember feeling so wounded,” said Phillips. “My entire world just came crashing down within the few minutes it took to walk into the bank. I was completely devastated.” 12 Deborah Moss tells The Post that she spent over a decade saving money in order to purchase a new house and do home renovations. photo by Chris Hardy California-based victim Moss was targeted by a fraudster who referred to herself as “Miss Barbara,” a rep for the bank, who called claiming that Moss’ ATM card had been compromised and that she’d be issued a new one in the mail. Miss Barbara, a sweet-sounding Southern belle, already had Moss’ phone number, address and banking information. The chiseler claimed that all she needed from Moss was a three-digit code that she’d received via text from the bank. An unwitting Moss recited the code to Barbara, not realizing that those numbers were actually granting the bilker authorization to make a $32,000 wire transfer from her account. And that was just the first grab. 12 Both the FTC and the FCC warn that business impostors, including bank fraud scammers, are on the rise. NongAsimo – stock.adobe.com Barbara called Moss for more than a week, each time claiming that her ATM card had been lost in the mail, and asking her to read off the new three-digit code she’d been messaged. After more than 10 calls, an admittedly “annoyed” Moss, who’d just relocated to a rural area with her partner, took the 40-minute trip into town to get a new card at a Chase branch. However, instead of a piece of plastic, the entrepreneur was given the shock of her life — and almost no sympathy. “The bank manager pulled up my account and said, ‘There’s no money in your account, whatsoever. As a matter of fact, in the last week, you’ve [accrued a] $989 deficit that you owe us,’” she recalled, alleging that the worker threatened to have her removed from the premises if she didn’t stop screaming. “I went to the cops, and they pretty much laughed in my face,” Moss claimed. “They said, ‘Oh, man, forget it. You’ll never get that money back.’ They didn’t do anything. There was no investigation.” 12 Moss claims she reached out to her bank and the police, as well as local and federal government officials, for help. photo by Chris Hardy Phillips alleges having a similarly unpleasant interaction with the New York Police Department immediately after being victimized. “I remember walking into the police station the same day this happened. I told an officer I’d been scammed out of thousands,” said the London native. “He laughed really loud and said, ‘You’re f—ked.’” “I was in disbelief,” said Phillips, adding that he’s more recently been contacted with an investigator, who allegedly “apologized” for his colleague’s conduct, and mapped out a plan to subpoena Chase for any information regarding the bank’s accounts in which monies were transferred. When contacted by The Post, a spokesperson for the NYPD’s Deputy Commissioner, Public Information provided the following statement: “There is a report on file for grand larceny, within the confines of the 75 Precinct. It was reported to police that on July 21, 2025, at approximately 08:00, a 33-year-old male received a call from an unknown individual claiming to work for Chase Bank who stated to the male that his account was compromised.

Lawrence, an elite interior defensive lineman considered one of the best players in the NFL, is having a substandard year as the Giants sputter through a 2-6 start, and Banks believes the players lining up against him don’t see him as a threat anymore, particularly after dislocating his elbow last season. “Dexter Lawrence, nobody respects you anymore. Nobody,” Banks said on his “Bleav in Giants” podcast with radio partner Bob Papa after Sunday’s loss to the Eagles. “Your opponents do not — the pre-injury Dexter is not there in their heads. They don’t respect you. And there’s a difference. You’re on the field, they’re blocking you with a [five]-year backup center. You’re not making a difference. The old Dexter would. There are a lot of things that go into your performance, only you know what that is. Whether you’re still recovering or not, I’m just telling you now, I’m looking at enough tape to know that your opponents don’t respect you, not like they used to.” Giants defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence.

Because even though some things may not pop up statistically or on the stat sheet, guys are still worried about Dex,” said defensive tackle Rakeem Nunez-Roches, who lines up next to Lawrence. “The way they block Dex is different from how they’ll block other D-linemen. When they see him out there, he’s still a threat. They still know they have to keep him covered up. They still know they have to double, triple or seal him off for certain things. So, yes, he’s still a weapon.” “I think Dex might not have the stats to back up how dominant he is,” right guard Greg Van Roten said, “but make no mistake about it: Teams focus a lot on him, and that frees up the guys around him to make plays.” After racking up a career-high nine sacks in 12 games and earning his third straight Pro Bowl nod last season before his injury, Lawrence has just half a sack — which he recorded Sunday — in eight games this year. He has just one tackle for a loss and four QB hits. A first-round pick by the Giants in 2019, Lawrence signed a four-year, $90 million contract extension before the 2023 season that runs through 2027. — Additional reporting by Ryan Dunleavy Filed under carl banks Dexter Lawrence New York Giants sports media 10/27/25 Read Next Giants coach gives Cam Skattebo update after emergency ank...

Trinity Shockley, 18, is set to plead guilty to felony conspiracy to commit murder in return for a maximum of 12.5 years behind bars plus five years of probation, according to the Morgan County Prosecutor’s office. Shockley was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and two terrorism-related charges for her alleged plan to shoot up Mooresville High School in Indiana. Morgan County Sheriff Trinity Shockley, 18, a transgender teen who was allegedly planning a mass shooting on Valentine’s Day, had an “obsession” with Nikolas Cruz. Google Maps Shockley — who authorities said identifies as male and uses the name Jamie — was arrested in February after police received a tip that she had access to an AR-15, had purchased a bullet proof vest, and was obsessed with mass shooters. When officers searched Shockley’s home, they found a twisted shrine to Parkland Florida mass shooter Nikolas Cruz, and other sick mass shooters.

In addition to jail time and probation, Shockley is also barred from researching school shooters for life – and will be required to download monitoring software on all electronic devices to be kept accountable. Shockley will be barred from ever owning a gun, and will have to pay for mental health counseling. The teen is expected to make the guilty plea in court on Nov. 24. Shockley was apparently suffering from a mental health crisis in the lead up to her arrest, with a guidance counselor reporting the teen had been struggling over the recent overdose death of her mother. She was also the target of school bullies after she and her father were severely injured in a car accident in 2022, and became the focus of a community fundraiser to help pay for her treatment, according to her family. But the teen’s grief took a hateful turn, with investigators saying they found journals filled with swastikas and phrases like “I hate you all DIE DIE DIE.” She’s also become obsessed with mass shooters, gushed about her interest in online chat rooms, and even confided her obsession to a school counselor.

The delivery giant announced on Sunday that it will distribute 1 million free meals and waive delivery fees for 300,000 grocery orders placed by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as part of an “Emergency Food Response” campaign set to run through November. The effort comes as state officials warn that food stamp funding could dry up by Nov. 1, leaving tens of millions without benefits and food banks overwhelmed by demand. 3 DoorDash is stepping in to feed hungry Americans as the federal government shutdown threatens to halt food stamp payments.

Fighting hunger is core to our mission at DoorDash, and we’re stepping up alongside leading grocers and retailers to help bridge the gap. We know this is a stopgap, not a solution.

Aristide Economopoulos DoorDash said it will also donate food and household goods from its DashMart locations to local pantries in hard-hit areas, with deliveries coordinated through nonprofit partners. The move comes as the monthlong government shutdown threatens the continuity of SNAP payments, a federal lifeline that helps 42 million low-income Americans buy groceries each month. The Department of Agriculture warned earlier this month that funding for November benefits would not be available if Congress fails to reach a budget deal. States including New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and California have already notified SNAP recipients that their benefits could be disrupted starting next weekend. 3 The delivery giant announced on Sunday that it will distribute 1 million free meals and waive delivery fees for 300,000 grocery orders placed by recipients of SNAP.

The shutdown has already delayed paychecks for more than 1.4 million federal employees and frozen dozens of federal programs. Food banks say they are already under strain. In Boston, the Greater Boston Food Bank estimated a potential loss of 56 million meals next month if SNAP funds lapse. Other food charities across the Midwest and South report surging lines and dwindling stock. “The food security of millions of people who rely on SNAP is at dire risk,” said Eric Mitchell, president of the Alliance to End Hunger, which is partnering with DoorDash.

Jacob Published Oct. 27, 2025, 2:40 p.m. ET Call this a design flaw. When Architectural Digest profiled Brooklyn influencer Molly Blutstein and her self-decorated Cobble Hill apartment this month, the feature seemed poised to celebrate the DIY charm and aesthetic experimentation of a social-media tastemaker. Instead, it ignited an online firestorm questioning both the magazine’s editorial standards and the influencer’s design credentials. Blutstein, an Atlanta native who runs a Substack called In The Details and has more than 200,000 Instagram followers, had moved to New York City in July and styled her railroad apartment herself. As the images show, there’s a lot of white paint — and not much else. 9 When Architectural Digest unveiled influencer Molly Blutstein’s Brooklyn apartment this month, readers didn’t exactly swoon — they staged a digital design intervention. Molly Blutstein/Instagram In the AD piece, she described her aesthetic as “Southern Gothic details, and sort of Shaker, but a bit English-style too,” adding that “it’s basically just Nickey Kehoe.” Explore More NYC penthouse once home to literary legends gets $1.5M price cut Lily Allen, David Harbour\u0027s lavish home listed for $8M — days after releasing her scathing breakup album Oceanfront mobile home in a Hamptons trailer park asks $3.49M — and it could tie a local record The article showcased her creative process — painting kitchen cabinets a soft yellow, sourcing second-hand furniture and applying faux butcher-block counters with the help of a TaskRabbit. “I’m really influenced by Southern design to some extent, or more traditional design. And I was raised on Pinterest.” 9 The Atlanta-born influencer, who moved to New York in July and decorated her Cobble Hill railroad apartment herself, described her style as “Southern Gothic details, and sort of Shaker, but a bit English-style too.” Molly Blutstein/Instagram 9 Critics on Reddit and Instagram blasted AD for featuring what they called “an unfinished Pinterest board copypaste apartment.” Molly Blutstein/Instagram She also made clear her aversion to one particular trend. “Midcentury. Don’t show me a tapered leg,” Blutstein told the magazine. But the Internet pounced — first on that statement, and then on the magazine itself. Commenters were quick to note that many of Blutstein’s featured furnishings were, in fact, midcentury in style. “Honest question; is this satire?? That’s like all mid-century stuff…” one Instagram user wrote. Another said, “Love this celebration of mediocrity.” Another asked, “No shade but… does she understand what ‘mid-century’ means?” 9 The article prompted strong backlash. 9 Others seized on Blutstein’s remark, “Midcentury. Don’t show me a tapered leg,” noting that much of her furniture was, ironically, midcentury in style. Molly Blutstein/Instagram On Reddit, the criticism grew sharper. “There is so much real artistic talent out there that is ignored to uplift the absolute most mediocre bulls—t ‘design’ from influencers who think being good at social media and buying clothes translates to other aspects of design,” one user wrote, adding, “The apartment isn’t even finished!! It’s basically empty!!!!” Others questioned why the feature appeared in Architectural Digest at all. “Why is this unfinished Pinterest board copy-paste apartment being featured in arch digest…” one commenter asked. Another said, “It’s her taste — and that’s perfectly fine — but let’s not pretend it’s something revolutionary.” 9 Blutstein, who has more than 200,000 Instagram followers and runs a Substack with 7,900 subscribers, cited designers like Beata Heuman, Heidi Caillier, Jessica Helgerson, and Nickey Kehoe among her inspirations, saying, “I’m really influenced by Southern design to some extent, or more traditional design. Molly Blutstein/Instagram 9 “My parents created a space where you could do and be whatever the hell you want … I reacted to that by honing in on how to make it feel less chaotic.” Molly Blutstein/Instagram Some defended Blutstein, arguing the real issue lay with AD’s editorial direction. “I guess fashion is more her thing … seems like something the editors should have caught,” one person wrote, while another observed, “I like that she’s exploring design on her terms, and I also recognize that AD and similar mags are going through a significant shift in readership — but I would really like it if AD could return to fostering thoughtful and educational discourse on design.” Blutstein, for her part, has cited a long list of influences — “Beata Heuman, Heidi Caillier, Jessica Helgerson, Billy Cotton, Hageman Homes \u0026 Interiors, Giancarlo Valle … Nickey Kehoe is also a big one,” she said. The AD feature described her taste as deeply personal, rooted in her upbringing. “My parents created a space where you could do and be whatever the hell you want,” she said. “If my mom felt like the kitchen needed to be yellow, she was going to paint it. I was going to come home and the kitchen was going to be yellow or green, or something. I reacted to that by honing in on how to make it feel less chaotic.” 9 Some defended her, arguing that AD — not Blutstein — deserved the criticism, saying, “I guess fashion is more her thing … seems like something the editors should have caught.” Molly Blutstein/Instagram 9 After Architectural Digest spotlighted influencer Molly Blutstein’s Brooklyn apartment, social media erupted with ridicule, questioning why the unfinished space appeared in such a prestigious design publication. Yet online, that individuality became a lightning rod for broader frustration over how influencer culture is shaping the design world. “Imagine all the real design talent that goes unseen and then there’s this,” one user lamented. Others turned their ire toward AD itself. “Whether we’re billionaires, or blue collar, isn’t that what this mag is supposed to offer? So why show us ‘influencers’ and celebrities rather than, you know, experts?” Neither Architectural Digest nor Blutstein has publicly addressed the backlash.

We may receive revenue from this partnership for sharing this content and/or when you make a purchase. Featured pricing is subject to change. Florence and the Machine are booting back up. The baroque pop rockers just announced they’re striking out on their ‘Everybody Scream Tour,’ the group’s first official jaunt since fall 2022. This upcoming international run comes in support of the octet’s forthcoming sixth studio album that shares a name with the tour and will take them all over the world from February through May 2026. That includes a pair of huge gigs in the five boroughs. First up, the Grammy nominees swing into New York City’s Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, April 21. Then, a few days, later, they’ll enchant Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Friday, April 24. “I can come here and scream as loud as I want,” frontwoman Florence Welch shared in an Instagram tour announcement post. While out and about, the “You’ve Got The Love” outfit will be joined by special guests Rachel Chinouriri, Sofia Isella, CMAT and Mannequin Pussy on select dates. Ahead of “Everybody Scream’s” Oct. 31 album release date, Florence and the Machine have released a trio of singles. They are “One of the Greats,” “Sympathy Magic” and the title track “Everybody Scream.” According to The Guardian, “the record is as strange, uncompromising and brutal as [Welch] has ever been…it is full of witchcraft and fury” and comes in the wake of the uncompromising singer’s brush with death following a miscarriage that led to internal bleeding and a near-death experience. Welch noted in her candid Guardian interview that “the closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death…and I felt like I had stepped through this door, and it was just full of women, screaming.” Her mystical record’s sound reflects this life-altering experience through ethereal, otherworldly vocals, mystical instrumentation and primal screaming. More on that later, though.

Based on our findings at Set List FM, here’s what they took to the stage that evening: 01.) “Heaven Is Here” 02.) “King” 03.) “Ship to Wreck” 04.) “Free” 05.) “What the Water Gave Me” 06.) “Dream Girl Evil” 07.) “Prayer Factory” 08.) “Big God” 09.) “Sweet Nothing” (Calvin Harris cover) 10.) “Hunger” 11.) “You Got the Love” (Candi Staton cover) 12.) “Choreomania” 13.) “Kiss With a Fist” 14.) “Dog Days Are Over” 15.) “Cosmic Love” 16.) “My Love” 17.) “Mermaids” Encore 18.) “Shake It Out” 19.) “Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)” Florence and the Machine new music As noted above, Florence and the Machine unveiled three singles prior to dropping “Everybody Scream” on Halloween. The title track, “Everybody Scream,” which also kicks off the 12-track album, starts mysteriously with a haunting, ghostlike marriage of unnerving yet magical vocals and instruments until the band blows it all up all at once with defiant electric guitar and primal screams. From there, the song finds a more straightforward groove yet never wavers from its impassioned ferocity as evidenced by unforgettable, piercing lyrics like “the witchcraft, the medicine, the spells, and the injections/The harvest, the needle, protect me from evil/The magic and the misery, madness and the mystery/Oh, what has it done to me? Everybody scream.” This one isn’t just a keeper. It’s an all-timer. Right after, FatM dive into the slow burn, tongue-in-cheek “One Of The Greats” that Florence described as an “lunatic, enormous, poem-rant-joke thing” to The Guardian. The song is likely referred to as a “joke” because Welch comes quite hard at male rockers with a focused intensity. Although she may toss off the song as a gag, lines like “It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can” and “It’s funny how men don’t find power that sexy/So this one’s for the ladies” cut through the noise and bring up a very real double standard in rock. Finally, the lilting, gentle “Sympathy Magic” discovers a real urgency one minute into its runtime and refuses to let up. The strings and piano reach a fever pitch and, as always, Welch’s immortal voice reaches impossible, sustained high notes. To hear all three equally gorgeous tracks for yourself, you can find “Everybody Scream” here. Florence and the Machine special guests At all concerts, Florence and the Machine will be joined by a special guest or two. To make sure you’re up to speed on their sounds, here’s each artist’s most-streamed song on Spotify.

The annual Christmas tree tapped to be the iconic centerpiece of the landmark Rockefeller Center has been picked from a suburban Albany farm, about 130 miles north of Manhattan, the center announced on Monday. The 11-ton, 75-foot Norway spruce tree, donated by the Russ family, was planted more than 60 years ago at their historic Rensselaer County farm. The majestic conifer marks a return to the Empire State — after last year’s tree made the pilgrimage from Red Sox country in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. 4 The 11-ton, 75-foot Norway spruce tree, donated by the Russ family, was planted more than 60 years ago at the historic Rensselaer County farm.

Getty Images The tree is among dozens of esteemed American arbors – mostly Norway spruces – used over the years for the wintertime ceremony, which dates back to 1931 when construction workers building Rockefeller Center erected a Christmas tree. Rockefeller Center’s head gardener Erik Pauze, the force in charge of finding the famous tree each year, found the Russ’ spruce as part of his year-round search across the East Coast. Pauze finally visited the upstate farm after a photo of the tree was given to him by a Rockefeller Center security supervisor earlier this year, Rockefeller Center reps said. 4 “It needs to make people smile the second they see it,” Pauze said. AP “As soon as I saw it, I knew it was perfect,” Pauze said. He then returned to the farm multiple times beginning this summer to water and care for the tree himself. “What I look for is a tree you’d want in your living room, but on a grander scale,” Pauze said in a statement. “It needs to make people smile the second they see it.” Filed under christmas christmas in rockefeller center manhattan midtown New York City Life rockefeller center the christmas tree upstate new york 10/27/25 Read Next Cuomo narrows gap against Mamdani as Dem socialist\u0027s lead ...

Many schools receive tens of thousands of applications each cycle, allowing the admissions officers only a few minutes to decide whether to consider the student or move on. That means every word of an application is crucial. In a recent survey, 91% of students said they were stressed about academics and college — and with good reason. Acceptance rates at top schools have plummeted. Meanwhile, the expectations haven’t budged, especially for students whose parents attended elite universities. “Using AI to write your essay will ultimately ruin and diminish your hard work. Admissions officers read thousands of essays — they know when the voice doesn’t sound like a teenager.“ Sophie Smith, co-found of College Contact Sophie Smith, co-founder and CEO of College Contact, has helped thousands of students get into their dream schools — and she’s seen just about every mistake in the book. To help high school seniors avoid these common errors, Smith — whose company has an 86% success rate of getting students into their first choice school — shared some of her top tips.

Even when they included the applicant’s race, gender and geographic location in the prompt — details that may help distinguish voice from one essay to another — researchers found that AI writing was easily distinguished from real human work. In her TikTok videos, Smith often cautions students against relying on AI tools to draft essays. While it might be tempting to use ChatGPT or another generator to “polish” your writing, Smith says admissions staff can usually tell when something feels off. “The strongest essays don’t just tell what you learned. They show it through storytelling and tone. Transformation is what makes an essay resonate — not the hardship itself, but what came after.” “Using AI to write your essay will ultimately ruin and diminish your hard work,” she said in a TikTok video. “Admissions officers read thousands of essays — they know when the voice doesn’t sound like a teenager.” Find the balance and keep it PG “If you wouldn’t feel comfortable saying it out loud to a trusted adult, reconsider [your essay topic],” she told The Post. See Also Startling 97% of Gen Z students are using AI to write essays, do homework — and even get into college Smith says one of the most common missteps she sees in essays is taking vulnerability or sensationalism too far. She emphasizes that good essays don’t need to shock or provoke. “Oversharing happens when an essay focuses more on shock value than reflection,” Smith said. Instead, she encourages students to focus on stories that reveal curiosity, growth or character. That could mean a lesson learned while coaching a younger sibling, or a small but meaningful moment that shifted your perspective. Today’s teens have grown up online, where posting about personal struggles feels normal in an era where “being authentic” often translates to oversharing. Combine that with a national mental health crisis, and it’s easy to see why so many essays read more like diary entries than reflections. But Smith says the solution isn’t to discourage emotion; it’s to channel it. “Our job isn’t to tell students to hold back,” she said. “It’s to help them shape those experiences into stories of reflection and growth. Vulnerability is powerful — but it needs to show maturity.” For today’s teens — who grew up sharing their lives online — finding the right balance between openness and professionalism can feel tricky. Smith’s ultimate message? Authenticity doesn’t mean baring your soul. It means showing judgment, maturity, and a clear sense of who you’re becoming. 3 Creativity is commendable, but don’t forget the basics of essay writing: Who, what, where, when and why. College Contact The 5 Ws See Also shared by spark admissions Meet the elite college admissions consultants beating the Ivy League admissions game One of Smith’s top tips for creating standout essays is deceptively simple — don’t forget the who, what, where, when and why. “If I read your essay and think 300 other students could’ve written it, it’s not specific enough,” she said. “Details are what make an essay unforgettable. Tell me what sweatshirt you were wearing, what the room smelled like, what song was playing. Those small choices show me how you think and what matters to you.” The goal isn’t to write an English paper — it’s to paint a picture of your personality. The most memorable essays, she adds, often reveal their true message in the final lines. “The strongest essays don’t just tell what you learned,” she adds. “They show it through storytelling and tone. Transformation is what makes an essay resonate — not the hardship itself, but what came after.” But again, be mindful of the details you share. “Admissions officers are evaluating judgment as much as storytelling,” she said. “If your story centers on breaking the law, it’s probably not the right vehicle to show maturity.” 3 College applications are a reflection of the whole student — and should be just as dynamic as the applicant’s own personality. Shutterstock / Travel_Adventure Piece it together like a puzzle While the essay gets a lot of attention, Smith reminds students that it’s just one piece of the puzzle. In today’s test-optional era, the college essay carries more weight than ever before. “Since many colleges no longer require SAT or ACT scores, the essay has become one of the clearest ways for applicants to stand out,” Smith told The Post. “Every section should reveal something new about your character or perspective. That’s how you help an admissions reader see the full you.” See Also Teens are losing their minds over college rejections — we need to give them some perspective While admissions officers are looking at the full picture of a student, including grades, extracurriculars and recommendations, which factors of an application get most heavily scrutinized by admissions counselors depends on the school, Smith explained. Some colleges. looking for high GPAs and course rigor, while others care more about personal insights. “Your activities list shows what you’ve done — your essay shows who you are,” she says. “If your essay touches on a club or project, focus on what it taught you, not just what you did. Every section should reveal something new about your character or perspective. That’s how you help an admissions reader see the full you.” That means using your extracurricular section to show what you’ve done, and your essay to show why it mattered. “Colleges are looking for students who are going to be positive role models, doers, self-starters and change-makers on campus and as future alumni,” she said.

Featured pricing is subject to change. I’ve been writing about beauty for several years now, so much so that I have a mental filing cabinet full of first-impression swatches, long-wear tests, and odd shade-matching mishaps. I’ve tried high-end luminizers, tinted moisturizers masquerading as foundations, and pretty much everything in between that can be tested with a foundation brush or sponge. When I first spotted the L’Oreal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion (yes, I’ll keep saying the full name; it’s worth it), I was curious. There’s no question about it — the glow market is absolutely saturated. Could this one genuinely stand out? Spoiler: yes, in many ways it does. Why is everyone hyped about Lumi Glotion? L’Oreal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion Amazon Pros: The finish is genuinely luminous and healthy-looking The formula feels comfortable on the skin (for me, no heavy film or weird tackiness) It plays nicely under other makeup Excellent value, considering the finish Doesn’t clog pores Cons: Coverage is minimal to none; it’s not designed to cover blemishes, redness or dark spots (if you rely on foundation to even out texture, you’ll still need something extra) Shade range could be more extensive, especially for deeper skin tones This radiant elixir, infused with glycerin and shea butter, hydrates your skin while gifting it a liquid gold glow that instantly transforms “just rolled out of bed” into “glow goddess in full effect.” Whether you smooth it all over for an all-day luminosity, dab it on your cheekbones as a highlighter, or mix it into your moisturizer for that effortless sheen, the Glotion delivers a radiant, lit-from-within finish that never looks overdone. It’s sheer, hydrating, and endlessly versatile. Size: 1.35 fluid ounces | Key ingredients: Glycerin (for hydration), Shea butter (for moisturizing) |Shade range: 4 shades AMAZON $17.99 $8.53 There’s a reason you might have seen a familiar face or two using it. For example, the “beach-glow” routine of Bethenny Frankel includes Lumi Glotion as her savior product for when she needs a radiant, healthy sheen. Then there’s talk that the glamorous skin of Martha Stewart owes at least part of her glow game to this very product. And while my only 30 seconds of fame comes from me wearing my Statue of Liberty skincare-testing headband on the New York Post Instagram account, I’m another devout fan — with a journalism degree and a knack for all things beauty. What makes the hype real is a combination of factors: the way the product straddles skincare and makeup (a “glotion” that hydrates and glows rather than only covers), the buildable nature of the finish (you can do a subtle “I woke up like this” glow or layer for more impact) and its versatility (face, body, under makeup, over makeup). It comes in a range of shades, so you can pick one to match your skin tone or for different application needs; I love that you can opt for a lighter shade for high points and a deeper one to bronze some areas. Key ingredients include glycerin and shea butter, which deliver hydration and softness rather than just sparkle. The product suite is also generous: you receive the standard 1.35-ounce full-size tube, and you’ll find it sold as an “illuminating glow lotion” that can be used all over. This is true, by the way. My Review Victoria McDonnell I approached this with typical beauty writer suspicion: OK, you say you glow. But make me glow. I chose the shade that matched my neutral-cool undertone (“902 Light”) and tried it in several ways: alone on bare skin, under a tinted moisturizer, and mixed into a lightweight foundation. First impression: smooth and lightweight texture, leaning more towards a lotion than a cream. It spread easily with my fingers, which I prefer because I felt more in control of placement. On bare skin, the Lumi Glotion gave me a soft, dewy sheen. Neither glittery nor in your face, but definitely more polished than a moisturizer used solo. One of the joys of this product is the buildable glow: I started with a thin layer all over and then added a dab to my high cheekbones and down the bridge of the nose. It made me look lke “me, but better”— a bell-shape of radiance without looking greasy. Under foundation, it worked beautifully as a luminous base; I followed with a lightweight tinted foundation, and the finish still glowed through. How I Use Lumi Glotion I found the best method is to treat it as both skincare and makeup. On no-makeup days, apply a thin layer all over the face (and neck if you like) after moisturizer, before sunscreen. For makeup days, apply it after moisturizer and before foundation, or mix a small amount into your foundation or tinted moisturizer to amplify glow. You can also use it as a highlighter or concealer alternative: a dab on cheekbones, bridge of nose, collarbone, or tops of shoulders if you want body glow. I especially liked mixing a drop into my foundation for a moisturized-glow finish. Additionally, I love buffing it out with a dense brush to serve as my bronzed contour. I use the “903 Medium” shade for that, and it gives that natural or “soft” definition many prefer to the harsh lines contour sticks can create. How Lumi Glotion Compares to More Expensive Alternatives I just ran out of my Yves Saint Laurent tinted foundation (that luxe one that offers medium‐to‐full coverage). The Lumi Glotion does not provide the same coverage; the YSL tinted foundation “covers” whereas Lumi is shine and light. However, the buildability (layering glow, mixing with mediums) is similar in spirit, and at a much cheaper price point, the Lumi wins for budget-friendliness. Impressively, it stands side by side with the Drunk Elephant B-Goldi bronzing drops that took TikTok and everyone’s wallets by storm. When you mix the fan-fave bronzing drops with a dollop of moisturizer, you achieve nearly the same glow as Lumi Glotion. It’s giving the same lit-from-within feel at a fraction of the cost. And, I found that unlike some other popular drug-store brand foundations, the Lumi did not clog my pores or feel heavy on the skin. I wore the Lumi Glotion and only the Lumi Glotion out to dinner on a date night — where I usually wear a tinted moisturizer at the very least — and I felt fully confident. This stuff is amazing, and I swear it’s worth every hype it receives. Who is Lumi Glotion best for? The rundown: who is Lumi Glotion best for? In my view, anyone who values lightweight, buildable glow, a budget-friendly price, and an option that doubles as primer or glow enhancer is a winner. It’s especially suited for normal to dry skin types who love that dewy finish, but it also works for combination skin. If you’re after full coverage or heavy mattes, this isn’t for you. On the flip side, if you want that healthy skin radiance, this could be your go-to. If I could give it an award or label, I’d call it the best budget glow whisperer because it doesn’t scream highlighter, it whispers, “you glow, naturally.” Is it worth it? My final verdict Yes, it is worth it. For the price (which is dramatically lower than many prestigious glow or bronze drops), the effect is luminous, flattering, and versatile. Lumi Glotion won’t replace your full-coverage foundation if that’s your style, but it will elevate your base, your no-makeup-makeup days, and your glow game overall. If I were recommending one single glow-lotion for someone new to the category, I’d pick this. The layering possibilities, the feel on skin, and the “you look radiant” effect are strong. Caveats: if you have very oily skin, you may need to powder the T-zone; if you have severe texture or blemishes, you’ll still need a concealer or foundation on top; if you have very deep skin tones, you might want to swatch carefully to ensure the undertone and depth match you well. But overall, it’s an excellent value, excellent finish, and I’ll be keeping a backup in my drawer. How I Tested I wore the Lumi Glotion over 7 consecutive full days (including one humid NYC subway commute, one outdoor lunch, one indoor air-conditioned coffeeshop workday with bright lighting, and one evening out). However, I’ve been donning this particular formula for years, and decided to put it to my beauty experiment for the purposes of this review. Each morning, I applied it in one of three ways: alone on bare skin, under a tinted moisturizer and mixed into foundation. I observed the finish immediately after application, after 4 hours, after 8 hours, and again after 12-plus hours (when relevant). I noted how it felt on my skin (weight, comfort, any stickiness), how it held up (shine, separation, texture accentuation), and how my skin responded (pore appearance, any breakouts, how it layered with other products). I also compared it to a week where I used no glow-lotion (my usual base) to see the difference. Lastly, I did side-by-side photos (same lighting) of bare skin versus Lumi base versus standard base to visually assess the glow effect. more affordable beauty favorites e.l.f.

New York City’s mayoral race is turning from a blowout into a competitive race – with ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo cutting front-runner Zohran Mamdani’s lead in half from a month ago, a new poll found. 3 Mamdani, seen today for a presser with local State Senator Liz Krueger, holds a 10-point lead over Cuomo just over a week before the election, according to a new poll. James Messerschmidt Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, now leads the independent Cuomo just 44% to 34% among likely Big Apple voters, according to the Suffolk University survey released Monday. The new survey’s margin is considerably tighter than the 20-point lead the democratic socialist Mamdani had over Cuomo in Suffolk University’s last poll conducted in September. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa remained in third place, notching 11% support in the recent survey – a haul that could ultimately keep Cuomo from thwarting Mamdani’s election despite the ex-gov’s recent gains, pollsters said.

J.C. Rice “That person isn’t Mayor Eric Adams, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Senator Chuck Schumer, or any New York billionaire,” he said. “It’s Republican Curtis Sliwa, whose voters hold the 11% blocking Cuomo from winning the race.” The latest survey was Suffolk’s first since Mayor Eric Adams dropped his pie-in-the-sky re-election bid and endorsed Cuomo. It was also the second poll to show the former governor narrowing the gap with Mamdani since Hizzoner’s fateful decision. Cuomo’s comeback comes with caveats, however, as the new Suffolk survey – conducted by phoning 500 likely general election voters from Thursday through Sunday – found a substantial portion of his support actually comes from opposition to Mamdani. When asked if their votes were more about voting “for” Cuomo or “against” Mamdani, the ex-gov’s likely voters showed a 40%-40% respective split in their reasons, the poll found. A resounding 79% of Mamdani’s likely voters, by contrast, said they were voting “for” the Queens assemblyman compared to the 7% who were doing so “against” Cuomo, according to the poll. 3 Cuomo (left) greets Mamdani before participating in a mayoral debate at Rockefeller Center on October 16, 2025.

He leads among independents by 10 points, a dramatic flip from a month ago, when he trailed Mamdani by 18 points among non-party-affiliated voters. Seven percent of voters were still undecided and the four other candidates whose names are on the ballot garnered 2% support combined. Sliwa remains a factor in the race. He and Cuomo are splitting the anti-Mamdani vote, making it harder to defeat the lefty Democratic nominee. Many of Sliwa’s voters would back Cuomo if the red-beret clad Guardian Angels founder were not in the race, the poll found. Cuomo would be the second choice of 32% of voters, compared to 3% for Mamdani, pollsters found. Other candidates listed on the ballot are Adams, who recently endorsed Cuomo, Conservative Party nominee Irene Estrada, and independents Joseph Hernandez and Jim Walden. Monday is the third of nine days of early voting preceding the Nov. 4 election.

How ‘play resistance’ can wreck your mental health — and your 10-minutes-a-day fix By Reda Wigle Published Oct. 27, 2025, 2:00 p.m. ET Have you traded the freedom of play for the confines of productivity? That bargain may be costing you more than you realize. According to one expert, unstructured play is one of the easiest ways to boost mental health, relieve stress and reconnect with the nourishing influence of our own inner child. “Everyone benefits from playing,” Cas Holman, author of the upcoming book Playful: How Play Shifts Our Thinking, Inspires Connection, and Sparks Creativity, told The Post. 3 Unstructured play is one of the easiest ways to boost mental health, relieve stress, and reconnect with the nourishing influence of our own inner child. DisobeyArt – stock.adobe.com He said that adults, in particular, need to engage in activities for the sheer joy of it, as most of us start skipping unstructured play around age 9. “We’re overly focused on productivity and outcomes, so we don’t listen to the part of ourselves that wants to be silly in a meeting, explore a new route to work, or dance around in the kitchen while we do dishes,” he explained. When we concern ourselves with what others think, Holman noted, it prevents our pursuit of play — an inhibition that can seriously affect our overall well-being.

A life devoid of play is detrimental to our psychological, emotional, and physical health.” How do you know if you’re “play-resistant”? According to Holman, there are five signs. 3 A life devoid of play is detrimental to our psychological, emotional, and physical health Halfpoint – stock.adobe.com See Also This physical activity is better at reducing stress than going to the gym — it’s not sex Five signs you are play- resistant Your idea of fun is checking things off a to-do list. You feel guilty when you take a break. You can’t remember the last time you laughed without a reason. You think “play” is for kids or weekends only. You’re always “busy,” but never “happy.” Studies have shown that a playful mindset makes people more adaptable, resilient and creative, while animal models indicate that play can make mammals more resistant to illness. Most of the adults Holman has encountered in the past two decades want to play but feel out of touch with that part of themselves. “I’d describe them as ‘play-curious’ or ‘play-hesitant’. They want to embrace it as part of their daily lives but aren’t sure how to,” he said. For those who want to reconnect with the spirit of play, Holman recommends allotting 10 minutes each day to something that feels fun, not productive. 3 According to Holman, play is not only an action, but an approach that can be applied to the most mundane of tasks. Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com See Also Here are the small things that are causing your anxiety to skyrocket — and your health to worsen “Dance in your living room. Draw doodles. Call a friend just to chat. The goal isn’t to accomplish anything — it’s to reconnect with joy,” he advised. Holman recommends starting with a specific “play memory.” “Just remembering an instance of play from your childhood will help you connect with the power of play, which in turn will help you prioritize it,” he explained. “You don’t need to clear part of your calendar or take a class (although those can both be fun!)” Play is not only an action, according to Holman, but an attitude and approach that can be applied to the most mundane of tasks. “Cooking breakfast can be playful. Throw together some combination of food you’ve not tried before and stay open to where it goes,” he suggested. “Rearrange your living room and see how it changes the way you live there. Translate for the birds in the morning.” To further infuse your life with the healthy levity of play, Holman recommends the following strategies. Release judgment: “Trust those around you not to judge you- and mostly trust yourself. We can be our own harshest critic. Let yourself play.” Embrace possibility: “Be open to what might happen rather than attached to what you expect or know. Being outcome-oriented can make things stressful and not very playful.” Reframe success: “Ask yourself what you are really after. Do you need to finish the hike in under an hour, or can you chase that chipmunk, notice the moss, and giggle at strange birds instead? You don’t need to ‘win’ the hike!” Filed under childhood exclusive happiness life hacks mental illness work 10/27/25 Read Next Your gray hair might actually be good for you The Latest Deals Walmart’s best deals of the week: Dyson, Chromebook, Michael Kors, more Wayfair cut this HENCKELS 14-piece Knife Set by 72% for Way Day Fry up savings of 25% off the Cosori 9-in-1 Air Fryer on Amazon Amazon’s deals of the week include Nespresso, Apple, eufy, more bestselling brands Prepare to be floored: Wayfair’s Way Day rug deals start at $49 this October Top Concerts Vividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post Get seats.

I just want to thank the city of Philly for taking the best care of me. Every moment I spent in the hospital with family and friends I felt loved and supported in every way. Thank you to the doctors, surgeons and staff that did their best work on me.” Dr. Eric Friedman — the Charleston, S.C.-based team doctor for USA Ski \u0026 Snowboard team — and NYU Langone sports orthopedic surgeon Kirk A. Campbell shared the opinion with The Post that Skattebo likely suffered an open fracture in addition to a dislocation, after reviewing television video of Skattebo’s gruesome injury Sunday against the Eagles. In other words, a bone punctured skin before Skattebo was placed in an air cast. “An open injury is considered an orthopedic emergency, and the big concern is that the sterile inside can be contaminated by bacteria on the dirty outside and you can have an infection complicate whatever injury you have,” Dr. Guillem Gonzalez-Lomas, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine who watched the video but has not examined Skattebo, told The Post. “In general, these are injuries we want to wash out with sterile saline and place the patient on antibiotics as soon as possible. 3 Cam Skattebo gets carted off after suffering an ankle injury against the Eagles on Oct. 26, 2025. AP “The fact that he had surgery [Sunday] night probably tells us that they felt it was very time sensitive. If you were able to get the ankle back in place, sometimes you would let the swelling go down for a week or two before proceeding with the definitive treatment.” Even with an open injury, Gonzalez-Lomas said “there is a good chance” Skattebo can be back on the field for training camp in July, barring any setbacks. Of course, running backs do more slashing, leaping and accelerating than other positions.

If you add a solid repair to it, you should have a stable ankle. The question is going to be more about stiffness, pain and if there are other associated cartilage injuries that may not manifest for several months or years. As far as him regaining stability and all of the muscle coordination that he needs to be able to play, that is something the training staff should be able to get him to — or close to — where he was.” Skattebo, who scored his fourth touchdown in 5 ½ quarters of two games against the Eagles on Sunday, was given a warm ovation by the notoriously hostile Philadelphia crowd as he rode off on the cart following the controversial tackle by Zack Baun. The show of respect between rivals continued Monday, when Eagles chief of security Dom DiSandro dropped off pizza and cheesesteaks for Skattebo at the hospital, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report. Skattebo, 23, was FaceTiming teammate Greg Van Roten and texting with head coach Brian Daboll late Sunday night and before dawn Monday. “Obviously, he’ll be missed, but he’s got a road ahead of him,” Daboll said. “A guy that has sparked us with a lot of energy and toughness, but the infectious personality that he has as well. It was at 4:08 a.m. I got a text from him. That’s Skatt. [His spirits] are as good as can be through text.” CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND GIANTS STATS The next two weeks will require rest, elevation and cryotherapy to bring down inflammation, Gonzalez-Lomas said. If all goes well, recovery will progress to non-weight-bearing range of motion exercises, and, in about 4-6 weeks, to protective weight-bearing exercises. In “several months,” after stiffness has decreased and strength is improved, he can progress to sports-specific activities. “The devil is in the details,” Gonzalez-Lomas said. “It really depends on how quickly he gets through every phase. The ankle suffered a lot of trauma. It’s going to take some time for all that energy to calm down. The main thing is you want to be like Goldilocks: You want to be doing everything just right.” 3 Medical staff attending to New York Giants running back Cam Skattebo (44) who injured his leg during a game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

It is unknown if Skattebo will need another surgery, but isolated ankle dislocations without fractures are considered rare. “As long as he can avoid infection,” Friedman said, “he should be ready to go Week 1 next year.” Filed under cam skattebo New York Giants ny sports minute 10/27/25 Read Next Fuming Aaron Rodgers has NSFW reaction to dropped touchdow...

AFP via Getty Images “You can’t expect them to make unbelievably complex chips and computers and other things and pick people off the unemployment line that haven’t worked in five years.” The president said factories that churn out “very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment” – like Hyundai’s new EV battery plant in Ellabell, Ga. – need to bring in specialized workers. While such foreign laborers should focus on teaching their American counterparts, it’s a process that takes time, Trump added.

Trump said Monday the White House is working on a “whole new” visa plan for specialized foreign workers. “They’ll teach our people how to do it. Our people will be just as good as they are within a period of time and it’ll be a phase out, but we want them to bring in experts and that’s the way it is,” he stated.

Jake Ratcliffe, 34, met his bride Rosie, 28, when she started volunteering at his animal rescue — Millington’s Magical Barn — five years ago. After spending the summer “mucking stables out and looking after animals together” the couple fell in love and married on August 2 in a converted cow barn on site. 7 Jake and Rosie posing behind a sign for Millington’s Magical Barn. Jake Ratcliffe / SWNS Special guest rescue sheep Bunny, who was born without the use of her back legs, walked down the aisle as ring bearer to the couple in her adapted chair – much to the delight of their 60 guests. Jake, an electrical engineer alongside his rescue work, from Wakefield, Yorkshire, said: “Last minute we were discussing ideas of who would be the ring bearer. “I always wanted Bunny – she’s always been a daddy’s girl. 7 Bunny wearing a blue harness and a floral decorative wheelchair. Jake Ratcliffe / SWNS “She arrived at Millington’s just as we were turning the cow barn into a wedding venue, so she spent six weeks with me whilst we all set up. “We did a bit of a rehearsal but with farm animals there’s not much training to it. “I kind of just had to rely on the fact me and Bunny had a special relationship and […] that she would come to me. “I had a bottle of milk on hand just in case. “I’m sure everyone expected us to have some form of animals involved. “It added to the feeling and made it all the more special”. 7 Jack and Rosie smiling at the top table with wedding guests in a barn. Jake Ratcliffe / SWNS Jake set up Millington’s Magical Barn in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 2018 as an animal lover with no previous experience in animal rescue. Since then, he has rescued over 200 animals who needed a home. Jake met wife Rosie, a veterinary nurse, when she started volunteering at the sanctuary in summer 2020 and went on to propose in August 2023. 7 Rosie preparing Bunny the sheep’s custom rig. Jake Ratcliffe / SWNS Jake said: “We had been scheduled to get married out in France. “Once we got into the organization of it, it didn’t feel right. “We spoke about it more and thought we met here, fell in love here and proposed here so it was only right we got married here too. “A sanctuary is not a wedding venue so we had to come up with a solution of where it [the ceremony] would be. “I told Rosie I’d convert the cow barn into a wedding venue. “Rosie was skeptical, but I’d like to say we pulled it off. 7 A rescue sheep named Bunny drinking from a bottle while dressed as a ring bearer at a wedding. Tanya Holliday / SWNS “She was worried about having a sheep involved as animals like cows, sheep and pigs are not as adaptive with commands and training as dogs are. “We said we’d have a backup so Alfie the bichon frisé, a childhood dog of Rosie’s, was the other ring bearer. “Just before the ceremony we lost him, and I had to hastily borrow my mom’s ring to put on her finger. “As soon as the confetti was thrown, we ran around the farm trying to locate the ring. “We thought, ‘where would Alfie go?’ “He was up in the cat’s room eating all their food with the ring on the floor next to him”. With Bunny the star of the show, the couple’s wedding guests loved her addition to the nuptials. 7 Bunny wearing a blue harness and mobility aid with wheels acts as a ring bearer at a wedding. Tanya Holliday / SWNS Jake said: “You can hear the collective ‘aw’ as she walked down the aisle. “Sometimes with our content it can divide opinion as a sanctuary rescuing animals that people don’t typically feel should be rescued, particularly disabled animals. “People comment nasty things about what we should do to the animals. “On this occasion the opinion was unanimous – everyone thought Bunny was amazing.

Bride Rosie said: “Everybody has their own idea of their dream wedding, and for me, a big fancy French wedding just didn’t fit. 7 Jake Ratcliffe with Bunny the sheep, who wears a mobility device. Jake Ratcliffe / SWNS “I’m much more of a simple girl, and getting married at home in beautiful Yorkshire, surrounded by our rescued animals, our friends and our family was what truly mattered. “We met at the sanctuary, we fell in love here, we even got engaged here whilst I was bottle feeding a lamb that had a collar on saying ‘turn around’. “It only felt right to complete the full circle and get married here. “It took a village to turn our working animal sanctuary into our dream wedding venue, but thanks to everyone who contributed it really was a dream day.” Filed under animal rescue animal shelters animals wedding themes weddings 10/27/25 Read Next Near-death experience study reveals the most common vision...

Try it free “No way. Not even dead,” Chapman said in Spanish on the “Swing Completo” podcast. “If I were told that I was being traded to New York, I’d pack my things and go home. I’ll retire right on the spot if that happens. I’m not crazy. Never again.” Luckily for Chapman, that seems unlikely to happen. The 37-year-old closer has resurrected his career with the rival Red Sox, and he signed a $13.3 million extension in September for the 2026 season. Chapman pitched parts of seven seasons with the Yankees, who initially acquired him from the Reds ahead of the 2016 season before dealing him to the Cubs for Chicago’s run to a World Series title. The Yankees then brought Chapman back, signing him to a five-year, $86 million deal. Chapman’s time with the Yankees was largely a success until his final season with the team in 2022. Chapman was erratic on the mound, missed a month of the season due to an infection stemming from a leg tattoo and lost his closer’s role. 3 Aroldis Chapman walks off the mound during a 2016 Yankees game.

And I just dealt with it quietly, kept playing, and doing what I always do.” 3 Aroldis Chapman celebrates after closing out Game 1 of the wild-card series against the Yankees on Sept. 30, 2025. AP Chapman said his issue was not with manager Aaron Boone nor any of his teammates, but with the Yankees “bosses.” “I got along well with all the players, never had a problem with anybody, even the manager. We’re friends and we talk and everything,” Chapman said. “The bosses are the ones who make those decisions.” Chapman’s career looked to be winding down after stops with the Royals, Rangers and Pirates.

The broadcaster was unaware of this requirement and was shocked when he could not board his flight home from Istanbul to Gatwick. \"Let\u0027s be clear: this isn\u0027t about paperwork. It\u0027s prejudice dressed up as policy. It\u0027s ignorant, insulting, and frankly medieval,\" Mr Mardell wrote on Facebook. The BBC has approached Turkish Airlines for comment. \"I\u0027d like to stress they are only the airline that had any mention of Parkinson\u0027s,\" he told the BBC. Mr Mardell is a former radio and television journalist who spent 25 years reporting and analysing major world events, notably for BBC Radio 4 and other radio outlets. In his Facebook post, Mr Mardell said he had checked in his suitcase but before he could get through security he was told he was not considered fit to fly. \"Rest assured, I wasn\u0027t drunk, violent, or even late. No, my sin was having Parkinson\u0027s,\" he said. \"They told us I couldn\u0027t board without a doctor\u0027s letter. At first, I thought they wanted proof that I had Parkinson\u0027s, which was absurd enough. But no - the letter had to say I was safe to fly. \"Apparently, Turkish Airlines has decided that people with Parkinson\u0027s are a danger to themselves or others.\" Image source, Mark Mardell Mr Mardell had taken the trip to Istanbul with his son Jake and used assisted boarding due to his condition, which he says has resulted in no boarding issues with other airlines. \"Parkinson\u0027s is the fastest-growing neurological condition on the planet. If you think that means we shouldn\u0027t be allowed on planes, you\u0027ve got a problem - and it\u0027s not neurological,\" he wrote in his Facebook post. The Turkish Airlines website states: \"Passengers who have Parkinson\u0027s disease are admitted to the flight with a doctor\u0027s report stating that \u0027there is no harm in traveling by plane\u0027. \"The report must include a statement specifying that the passenger can travel accompanied or unaccompanied,\" the website adds. A doctor\u0027s report provided must be recent and usually compiled within the last 10 days. But Mr Mardell listed British Airways, Lufthansa, American, Emirates, and Qantas as examples of major airlines that do not require a doctor\u0027s report if the passenger has Parkinson\u0027s. \"Turkish Airlines stands alone in demanding people with Parkinson\u0027s must bring a doctor\u0027s note. That\u0027s not \u0027assistance\u0027; that\u0027s a barrier,\" Mr Mardell said. The journalist said he found most of the Turkish Airlines staff he encountered unhelpful and they left him \"staggering\" around the airport alone for hours trying to find his suitcase.

The four men and one woman plied their victims - aged between 16 and 30 - with drugs at various properties between 2021 and 2022. Ringleader Marian Cumpanasoiu, 38, along with Remus Stan, 35, Cristian Urlateanu, 41, Catalin Dobre, 45, and Alexandra Bugonea, 35, were previously convicted of 30 charges at the High Court in Glasgow. Cumpanasoiu was sentenced to 24 years, Urlateanu to 20 years, Stan to 12 years, Dobre to 10 years and Bugonea to eight years. Grooming gang convicted of raping women in Dundee Published 9 January Met Police reviewing 9,000 grooming cases Published 3 days ago Judge Lord Scott said that a number of the group \"deflected and minimised\" their offending against vulnerable victims. He added: \"By offering them an unending supply of mostly free crack cocaine you exacerbated their vulnerabilities and proceeded to exploit them for your own sexual gratification and in some cases for financial gain. \"No doubt you assumed rightly for some time that the drug-related lifestyles of the women meant that you were not reported or detected.\" The judge said that the gang used the vulnerability of the women \"to try to attack their credibility\". Lord Scott continued: \"It may be you thought that no-one cared for your victims meaning you could do whatever you wanted to them without consequence. If so, events have proved you wrong. \"Each of the women found the strength to give evidence despite their difficulties and have taken steps to move on from that stage in their lives.\" Image source, Crown Office Image caption, A bed inside the brothel on Bright Street, Dundee The judge said it would be a matter for the Home Office but it was likely the gang would be deported on completion of their sentences. Three gang members - Urlateanu, Dobre and Bugonea - fled the country but were traced and extradited back to Scotland from Belgium and the Czech Republic for their trial last December. Jurors in the six-week trial heard harrowing testimony about how the gang preyed on the women, most of whom were already troubled by personal issues. Cumpanasoiu was found guilty of 10 charges of rape, while Urlateanu was convicted of six rapes. Cumpanasoiu was also convicted of a charge under the Human Trafficking Act, by forcing a woman into prostitution, and two charges of brothel keeping. Stan was found guilty of four rapes while Dobre was found guilty of two rapes. Alexandra Bugonea was convicted of one rape and illegal sexual activity with another.

This video can not be played Media caption, Grooming gang ringleader was described as a \"winking, smirking pimp\" Police Scotland uncovered the gang\u0027s activities during an operation focusing on the trafficking of woman to Dundee from eastern Europe to work as prostitutes. But officers discovered vulnerable local women were also being groomed with gifts and drugs, including crack cocaine. Some members of the gang worked in legitimate jobs as food delivery drivers, but were also grooming a succession of young women from the local area. The women were forced to have sex with the gang, and encouraged to recruit friends to come to the properties with the promise of drugs. Victims were plied with whisky and crack cocaine as well as being made to take part in \"sex games\". The gang was led by Cumpanasoiu, who was described as a \"winking, smirking pimp\" who behaved with a \"predatory nature\" towards women. Following the sentencing, the Crown Office released mobile phone footage of Cumpanasoiu in his car singing along to the 50 Cent song P.I.M.P. Image source, Crown Office Image caption, A knife which belonged to Marian Cumpanasoiu One of the victims was forced into prostitution after Cumpanasoiu and Stan set up a profile of her on a website and drove her to meet men to have sex with. This victim was said to have been sold a \"pipe dream\" of how she could make \"lots of money\" from selling her body. But Cumpanasoiu was said to be angry at one stage at her not earning enough. A video was found on his phone recording the victim climbing a tree. Cumpanasoiu was said to have threatened: \"Because you do not make money, you stay all day in the tree.\" He and Stan also raped the woman. Image source, Crown Office Image caption, Conditions were grim inside the flat on Bright Street Cumpanasoiu was described by one victim as \"absolutely relentless\" and another was left feeling \"disgusted\" by him. Cumpanasoiu claimed he only gave another of the young women crack cocaine to be \"polite\". Alexandra Bugonea, who was a prostitute in Dundee, admitted having \"sex parties\" at her flat and described them as having a \"fun atmosphere\". But one victim described seeing Bugonea semi-naked and teaming up with her then-boyfriend Cristian Urlateanu to rape. Quizzed about sexually assaulting any of the victims, Bugonea said: \"I am a woman - why would I have a plan to rape her?\" She also denied women only visited due to their drug issues, claiming she believed they were \"friends\". There was also testimony of how Urlateanu, Stan and Dobre raped another woman. To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This video can not be played Media caption, Judge Lord Scott told the gang during their sentencing that they exacerbated the vulnerability of the young women Lord Scott said Cumpanasoiu had \"lied, denied and deflected\" and \"shown no meaningful insight or remorse\". The court heard he was key to the identification, targeting and recruitment of women for sexual exploitation and supplied them with crack cocaine. The judge also said Cumpanasoiu presented a \"high threat of harm to women\". His 24-year sentence will be split between a 20-year custodial term and a four-year extension. Urlateanu\u0027s sentence was also divided between an 18-year custodial term and a two-year extension. Meanwhile, Bugonea wept in the dock after she was jailed for eight years. The jury heard she had difficult childhood experiences and may too have been exploited by others. But the court heard her involvement, whether deliberate or not, may have helped to lure some of the victims and assure them that they would be safe. Non-harassment orders were granted which prohibit the group from contacting their victims for an indefinite period. They were also put on the sex offenders register. Stan was separately given a five-year trafficking exploitation order. Image caption, DI Scott Carswell led the investigation into the gang Fiona Kirkby, procurator fiscal for high court sexual offences, said: \"This gang ruthlessly exploited vulnerable women for their own gain, without any regard for the suffering and trauma they caused. \"These were truly reprehensible crimes, and the victims must be commended for their courage in speaking out.\" Det Ch Insp Scott Carswell thanked the force\u0027s partners who supported the victims throughout the investigation. He also urged people to contact officers directly if they have any concerns. Det Ch Insp Carswell added: \"Victims are often vulnerable, they may be trapped with limited freedom or options, and sometimes they may not realise that they are in fact victims. \"That call can be the first step in freeing someone from slavery and exploitation.\" Related topics Dundee","category":"","leftBias":0.3116583,"centerBias":0.3691715,"rightBias":0.3191702},{"title":"The English We Speak: Make a pig\u0027s ear of something","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0mc1mkw","sourceName":"BBC News","publishedAt":"2025-10-27T12:37:00Z","description":"This expression is about doing something badly.

The Global Story Play BookmarkBookmark SubscribeSubscribe Available for over a year President Trump is in Asia this week to strike deals with several countries, including with China. One of the big questions overshadowing the trip is Taiwan’s future. China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with self-governing Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force. On Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US wouldn’t abandon the island in exchange for a favourable deal with China. But a tug of war has been playing out inside the Trump administration over whether a military battle for Taiwan – if China did try to seize it – would be in America’s best interests.

Many who followed the live broadcast on TV told me they are surprised by President Paul Biya\u0027s win of over 80% of votes in the region, which has long complained of marginalisation by his government. The region\u0027s capital city, Bamenda, remains calm. The main street, Commercial Avenue, is completely deserted except for heavily armed security forces stationed at the grandstand where official parades are usually held. A Cameroon flag flutters on one of the trucks as if celebrating the win. In the district of Bamenda I, the administrative seat of the region, a few cars and bikes can be seen on the road but no blaring horns and no signs of celebrations. A governing CPDM party official, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC: \"We are happy the North-West region contributed in giving President-elect Paul Biya a massive win. \"We look forward to organizing a celebration party in the days ahead.

Just four months before the polls, he stunned the public by quitting the government and announcing he was running for top office. After the polls the 76-year-old once again broken rank, announcing himself the winner before any official results were released, and telling the BBC, \"there is no doubt, no shadow of doubt whatsoever. My victory is undeniable\". Formerly a prominent minister and long-time ally of President Paul Biya, his critics had said they did not want someone who could represent a continuation of the Biya regime\u0027s 43 years in power. While he was communications minister, one of Tchiroma Bakary\u0027s most egregious actions was his denial, external - then backtracking on his denial - that Cameroonian soldiers had killed women and children in a viral video verified by BBC Africa Eye. His most recent post was employment minister, presiding over 40% joblessness among the under-35s, external - even the most qualified young Cameroonians in possession of multiple university degrees struggle to find work. Tchiroma Bakary\u0027s supporters, however, said his knowledge of Cameroon\u0027s inner workings made him the best choice. They hoped his chances at victory would also have been aided by the elimination of popular opposition figure Maurice Kamto. Speaking to the BBC last week, Tchiroma Bakary did not condemn the sometimes violent protests by his supporters in his stronghold of Garoua, and instead said he urged them to defend their votes, adding: \"We will never accept their votes being stolen by anyone.\" Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing \u0027Graveyard silence\u0027 after Biya\u0027s winpublished at 14:26 GMT 27 October 14:26 GMT 27 October We are getting more reaction to Paul Biya\u0027s contentious win from voters across Cameroon.

Almost four out of 10 people in the country between 15 and 35 are unemployed and just under a quarter of young graduates face challenges in obtaining formal employment, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). \"Young people are more inclined to emigrate abroad because they tell themselves that inside the country, they do not have the possibility of becoming somebody,\" 26-year-old graduate Vanina Nzekui told the BBC in the run-up to the election. \"They tell themselves that all positions are occupied by older people,\" she said, adding that this comes at the cost of using their skills to help develop the country.

Education Minister Amadou Sy Savane announced on state television that all education institutions would remain shut until 9 November, saying the movement of staff and students had been affected by the blockade. He said the authorities were \"doing everything possible\" to end the crisis so that classes could resume on 10 November. For weeks, Mali has been hit by a fuel shortage, especially in the capital Bamako, after militants from an al-Qaeda affiliate imposed a blockade by attacking tankers on major highways. Mali is landlocked, so all fuel supplies are brought in by road from neighbouring states such as Senegal and Ivory Coast. Long queues have been snaking around petrol stations in Bamako in recent weeks, and the city\u0027s usually crowded streets have now reportedly fallen quiet. The military government had earlier this month assured residents that it was only a temporary issue, but the crisis has persisted. Last week, the US Embassy in Bamako announced that non-essential diplomatic staff and their families would leave Mali amid the worsening fuel shortage and growing security concerns. It said the fuel disruptions had affected the supply of electricity and had the \"potential to disrupt the overall security situation in unpredictable ways\". Mali is currently ruled by a military junta led by Gen Assimi Goïta, who seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta had popular support when it took power, promising to deal with the long-running security crisis prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north by ethnic Tuaregs, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants. The UN peacekeeping mission and French forces had been deployed in 2013 to deal with the escalating insurgency. Both have left since the junta took over, and the military government has hired Russian mercenaries to tackle the insecurity. However, the jihadist insurgency has continued and large parts of the north and east of the country remain outside government control.

The regional governor, Samuel Dieudonné Diboua, said police posts had come under attack and security forces had defended themselves. Hundreds of supporters of opposition presidential candidate, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, defied a ban to hold protests in several cities, clashing with security forces. Tchiroma Bakary has insisted he won the presidential election held on 12 October, challenging incumbent President Paul Biya\u0027s 43-year-old hold on power. The ruling CPDM party has dismissed the claims. Diboua condemned the deadly protests that he described as \"premeditated acts of violence\" and a serious attack on public order and national security. \"Four people unfortunately lost their lives,\" he said, adding that several members of the security forces were also injured. \"Investigations have been opened, so that light can be shed on these unfortunate incidents,\" he added, while threatening to take action against the instigators. In Tchiroma Bakary\u0027s stronghold of Garoua, a city in the north of the country, police fired tear gas and water cannons at his supporters. The protesters were denouncing what they said was a plan by the ruling party, the Cameroon People\u0027s Democratic Movement (CPDM), to \"steal the victory\" from the opposition leader. The demonstrations came after Tchiroma Bakary called on his supporters in the country and the diaspora to march peacefully to \"liberate Cameroon\". Authorities have banned gatherings until Monday, when Cameroon\u0027s constitutional council is set to announce the results. In Garoua, the demonstrations began peacefully but quickly turned rowdy when security forces threw teargas on the streets to disperse the hundreds of people that had gathered in support of Tchiroma Bakary. \"We are not here for disorder. We\u0027re demanding the truth of the ballot,\" a placard read. One protester was seen carrying a banner urging US President Donald Trump to help them. \"We are here to claim our victory. We are making a peaceful march, which is a civil right for all Cameroonians - for everyone,\" another protester said. Supporters also took to the streets in the south-western city of Douala. \"We want Tchiroma, we want Tchiroma,\" protesters chanted, Reuters news agency reports. Image source, Michel Mvondo/BBC Image caption, The protests came after Tchiroma Bakary called on his supporters to march peacefully following the presidential elections Tchiroma Bakary previously told the BBC that he would not accept a stolen vote. He said his team had compiled the overall picture based on results from individual polling stations. In a video statement posted on social media, Tchiroma Bakary said he had won the election with about 55% of the vote, based on what he said were returns representing 80% of the electorate. The 76-year-old former government minister broke ranks with Biya, 92, who is seeking another term after 43 years in power. CPDM has dismissed Tchiroma Bakary\u0027s victory claims and several officials have described it as illegal because only the constitutional council can proclaim official results. Opposition supporters have alleged that the 12 October poll was marred by irregularities, including ballot-stuffing. Judges on the constitutional council dismissed eight petitions, citing insufficient evidence of irregularities or a lack of jurisdiction to annul results. Tchiroma Bakary refused to file complaints with the council, whose judges have been appointed by Biya, choosing instead to declare himself the \"legal and legitimate president\". Born in Garoua, Tchiroma Bakary trained as an engineer in France before returning to Cameroon to work for the national railway company. In 1984, he was thrown in jail, accused of being involved in an attempt to depose President Biya. Despite denying the allegation and never being convicted, Tchiroma Bakary spent six years in prison. He also served as communications minister from 2009 to 2019. In this role and as the government\u0027s spokesperson, he resolutely defended Biya\u0027s government during crises such as the Boko Haram insurgency, when the army was accused of killing civilians. But in June, just four months before the general election, Tchiroma Bakary changed course dramatically, resigning from the government and announcing he would run against Biya for the presidency.

The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, representing trusts and other health organisations, said in a joint statement that the cost of covering redundancies and strikes, along with paying more for medicines, was not included in the budget this year and will need extra cash from the Chancellor. Talks between the Department of Health and the Treasury are ongoing, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has confirmed. Responding to the statement, the Department of Health said the government was committed to \"properly funding\" the NHS. Cuts to NHS services and jobs could mean fewer tests, appointments and operations being carried out. Senior managers say that demands from the government for significant job cuts in regional health boards and NHS trusts have been made without any promise of extra funding to cover at least £1bn of redundancy payments. The merger of NHS England and the Department of Health will also involve staff reductions which have to be paid for. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers say that the doctors\u0027 strike in England in July led to £300m of costs for NHS trusts, including covering rota gaps. The cost is likely to be the same again during the next planned strike in November, they claim. They go on to argue that a likely deal with the United States over higher medicine prices could cost the NHS around £1.5bn. The US administration and major pharmaceutical companies have been pushing the UK government to raise the amount paid for drugs. The drug companies argue that investment in UK research and development of new medicines could be cut if a deal is not agreed. Health leaders have also warned that progress on reducing waiting lists will be affected if there is no Treasury help in making up the financial shortfall. Some argue that uncertainty over redundancy plans is distracting staff and managers from the task of turning round the NHS. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \"The threat from un-budgeted redundancy payments, higher drug prices and renewed industrial action risks derailing progress on key waiting time targets and the wider reforms that are essential to getting the NHS back on track.\" Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \"Redundancies cost money, making it harder to make long-term savings without government support. \"As the government prepares its Budget it\u0027s time for an honest assessment and discussion about what the NHS can really achieve this year in these challenging financial circumstances - and about what is \u0027doable\u0027\u0027 to meet ministers\u0027 ambitions in their 10-year plan for health.\" A Department for Health and Social care spokesperson said: \"This government has delivered a record-breaking £29 billion investment in our NHS – including up to £10 billion on digital and technology transformation and £750 million for urgent capital repairs – demonstrating our unwavering commitment to properly funding the health service that we all rely on. \"However investment alone isn\u0027t enough - it must go hand in hand with reform. That is why we\u0027re doing things differently: not just fixing the NHS but moving it forward through our Plan for Change\" Get in touch Are you on an NHS waiting list for a routine operation or cancer treatment?

Read Full Bio Mary Cunningham Updated on: October 28, 2025 / 7:46 AM EDT / CBS News Over the past year, Suzann Hernandez and Camilo Aguirre have put a lot of effort into lowering their energy bill. Beyond simple solutions like turning off lights or closing doors when either the heat or AC was on, the couple insulated their windows and kept the temperature set at a strict 76 degrees, even on the hottest days of summer. Despite their best efforts, however, their energy savings strategy had little impact against a rate hike that went into effect in their home state of New Jersey on June 1. The increase, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in February, raised the average electric bill for residents in the state by 17%, according to a letter the state\u0027s largest utility company sent to customers earlier this year. \"We thought [we\u0027d] see at least a $50 decrease,\" Hernandez told CBS News\u0027 correspondent Tom Hanson. \"When we compared it to what we got this year, we only saw a $20 decrease.\" It\u0027s not only residents in the Garden State who are feeling the pinch of higher prices. \"This is a national problem,\" Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told CBS News. According to a new report from PowerLines, a nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills, utility rate increase requests and approvals totaled more than $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025. That\u0027s almost double the $16 billion in requests and approvals over the same period in 2024. Those rate hikes are expected to show up in the bills of over 124 million customers this year, PowerLines found. For those Americans already struggling to make ends meet the hikes will mean additional economic hardship, the organization said in its report. By and large, customers nationwide are feeling powerless in the face of the escalating energy costs. \"It feels like there\u0027s nothing we can do about it,\" said Karin Gudal, an AES Ohio customer quoted in PowerLines report. \"We can try to make our buildings as energy efficient as we can...but even that takes money.\" Data shows that utility prices for American households have continued to climb. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential electricity prices this year were up 11% in August from January. Politicians, meanwhile, are using their campaign platforms to cater to frustrated voters. In New Jersey, for example, rising energy prices is an issue gubernatorial race candidates have latched onto in the lead up to elections on Nov. 4. In their campaign ads, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli promise they will help curb energy bills if elected. Cassino expects the issue, which has consumed the political race in New Jersey, will soon reverberate in races throughout the country. \"This is a harbinger of what\u0027s gonna happen next year in the midterm elections,\" he said. \"This issue\u0027s not going to go away. It\u0027s not like the power bills are going to go down.\" Edited by Anne Marie D.

Joe previously covered breaking news for Forbes and local news in Boston. Read Full Bio Joe Walsh Updated on: October 28, 2025 / 5:11 AM EDT / CBS News President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia. The deal — which the two countries agreed to over the summer — will see the U.S. charge 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It\u0027s not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go. Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan\u0027s first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia and Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington. During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\" President Trump and Japan\u0027s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shake hands during a signing ceremony at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, Japan, Oct. 28, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/AP \"We\u0027re going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\" Japan is the United States\u0027 fifth-largest trading partner, according to federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods. More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year — or $52.3 billion — were cars and car parts, powered by Japan\u0027s massive auto industry, according to federal data. The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S. During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo\u0027s Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\" It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump\u0027s up until his assassination in 2022. \"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi\u0027s hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe\u0027s assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun. In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers\u0027 two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory. Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\" The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000. She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\" She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open. \"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\" When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities — whether people like it or not, it\u0027s what we\u0027re doing.\" Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S. strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we\u0027ll stop the drugs coming in by land.\" Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening. On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo\u0027s imperial palace. Trump to visit South Korea next — and meet with China\u0027s Xi Jinping South Korea is the next and final stop on the president\u0027s trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn\u0027t expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they\u0027re close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S. The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China — for a total rate of 140% — starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing. On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump also said he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are no such plans for a meeting.

It\u0027s estimated that tens of thousands of children in Allegheny County alone are on SNAP benefits. With the potential for those to go away, it puts more pressure on school districts to help kids get the food they need. Schools all across the region run backpack programs that get food to families who need a helping hand. Down at Baldwin High School, they have the Purple Pantry. It started a couple of years ago and addresses students weekly and on an as needed basis with food and other needs like hygiene products. \"As teachers and educators and those of us, whatever our role is in education, I think we just feel that natural calling to support our students not just within the walls of our classroom,\" teacher Becca Mackin said. They expect that need to go up. So far this year, they\u0027ve seen a change from just needing snacks to more meal foods like pasta and rice. Gateway\u0027s program says they expect to see an increase in the upcoming weeks for their weekly distribution. They currently serve about 200 students a week. Franklin Regional\u0027s program runs every other week. Nothing is finalized, but changing that to weekly is not out of the question. \"I think we continue as a school district just to provide support in so many different ways, not just food directly,\" Franklin Regional school counselor Doug Kelly said. For students on the free and reduced lunch programs, they will still qualify for the meals, even with SNAP stopping. According to food service directors, students qualify for the whole year. \"Their child can have food at school, two meals a day, every day for free,\" Baldwin Whitehall food service director Joyce Weber said. All the school pantry and backpack programs ask if people can help to lend a hand and donate nonperishable food items.

The epicenter of the earthquake was determined to be southeast of Columbia, Maryland, near Hopewell Park. There were no reports of injuries or damage. A small 2.5 magnitude earthquake was reported in Howard County, Maryland, on Monday, Oct. 28, 2025, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). United States Geological Survey (USGS) The earthquake was felt by residents in the area around 5:17 p.m. between U.S. 29 and Interstate 95, according to WJZ\u0027s First Alert Weather team. USGS reported that the depth of the earthquake was about 7.7 km. Small areas in Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties and Baltimore City felt the earthquake, as well as communities in Howard County, including Clarksville, Savage, and Fulton. Some residents of Burtonsville in Montgomery County also reported feeling the earthquake. Rebecca Kavage Adams, a geologist with Maryland\u0027s Department of Natural Resources, said about 1,000 people reported feeling the earthquake. \"Every now and then, we do feel one because it does get above two,\" Kavage Adams said. According to data from the USGS, nearly 1,080 people reported feeling the earthquake, mostly in the Columbia area. Residents react to Maryland earthquake Brooke Johnson and Damya Pittman were practicing with their cheer squad at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia when they felt the ground briefly shake. \"We were just in practice and we felt a thump,\" Johnson said. Pittman said the quake was small, but it made her question what had happened. \"It wasn\u0027t too extra,\" she said. \"It was like something fell. I was like, \u0027What is that?\u0027\" The Howard County government said Police and Fire were aware of the situation and are surveying for potential damage. 2024 earthquakes in Maryland This is not the first time seismic activity has been reported in Maryland. Earthquakes occur when the Earth\u0027s tectonic plates shift. In June 2024, a 1.8 magnitude earthquake was reported, with an epicenter in Spencerville, Montgomery County, according to the USGS. According to the USGS website, that quake was also felt in Wilmington, Delaware, and Columbia, Maryland. Maryland felt a much larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024, which was centered in New Jersey. People in other northeastern locations, including New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, felt that quake. In January 2024, a small-magnitude earthquake shook the Washington, D.C., suburb of Rockville, Maryland, the USGS said. A 2.3 magnitude earthquake happened shortly before 1 a.m. at a depth of about 9.5 miles, about 2 miles west of Rockville. No damage or injuries were reported, but nearly 2,000 people, from six states and Washington, D.C., reported feeling the earthquake, including people in Baltimore, and as far away as Pennsylvania and West Virginia. \"This is a pretty normal occurrence.

Read Full Bio Todd Feurer Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 9:03 PM CDT / CBS Chicago A first-degree murder arrest warrant has been issued for the estranged husband of a woman found dead at the bottom of a Chicago condo building stairwell last year. The warrant, issued by a Cook County judge on Monday, charges Adam Beckerink with one count of first-degree murder in the death of his estranged wife, Caitlin Tracey. According to a criminal complaint, Beckerink killed Tracey on Oct. 25, 2024, by \"throwing her over the railing of the 24th floor of the east stairwell of 1201 South Prairie Avenue,\" the South Loop condo building where Beckerink lives. A tenant found Tracey\u0027s severed foot in a stairwell in the condo building two days later, and police later found her body at the bottom of the stairs. Beckerink had called police the day before to report her missing, according to court records. He was held for questioning for two days, but released without charges in connection to her death. Last week, Beckerink pleaded no contest to domestic violence charges in connection to two incidents at Tracey\u0027s home in New Buffalo, Michigan, as well as one count of contempt for violating his bond, and was sentenced to 93 days in jail. He is currently being held at the Berrien County Jail in Michigan, according to jail records. Tracey\u0027s parents released a statement Monday evening expressing gratitude to the Chicago police and Cook County State\u0027s Attorney Eileen O\u0027Neil Burke, calling the charge \"another big step in the path to obtain justice for Caitlin.\" \"We dearly miss Caitlin as do her friends. Our family hopes that during the murder case against Adam Beckerink, that the truth about the last months of Caitlin\u0027s life and the events leading to her tragic death are revealed, so our wonderful daughter can finally be laid to rest,\" the statement said. Tracey had filed for an order of protection against Beckerink in October 2023, citing four incidents in which she accused him of physically and verbally abusing her, and claiming she feared further abuse. She later withdrew the petition after her husband threatened to sue her for defamation and libel, according to court records. Court records also show Beckerink was arrested twice in New Buffalo, Michigan, where Tracey lived, for domestic violence against her in 2024. Following Tracey\u0027s death, her husband and her parents spent more than two weeks in a custody battle over her remains, before a judge in Michigan allowed her parents to take custody of her body for a funeral and burial.

Read Full Bio Dr. Céline Gounder October 27, 2025 / 5:13 PM EDT / CBS News In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month\u0027s end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid. \"People don\u0027t realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they\u0027re gone,\" George Hill, the group\u0027s president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\" Maine Family Planning\u0027s closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u0027 Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net. \"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you\u0027re removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It\u0027s like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\" Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA\u0027s statutory functions.\" How the safety net frays For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance. In mid-October, OPA\u0027s operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy — expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration\u0027s Make America Healthy Again agenda.\" According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains. \"The structure to run the nation\u0027s family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA\u0027s former chief clinical adviser. \"This isn\u0027t just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It\u0027s a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\" A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson\u0027s War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines. Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself. \"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women\u0027s and children\u0027s health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn\u0027t a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\" UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey\u0027s research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years. Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century — a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\" That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today\u0027s unraveling especially striking. \"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it\u0027s being undone by neglect.\" The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births. \"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart\u0027s workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\" Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they\u0027re growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now. \"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said. James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards. What history and the data predict happens next Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits. \"If these clinics close, we\u0027ll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.\" And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there\u0027s no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control. \"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\" The high price of short-term savings Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs. Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn\u0027t saving money. It\u0027s wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We\u0027ll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\" Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities. Strain on the ground Affirm, Arizona\u0027s Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open. \"Some partners haven\u0027t been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Bré Thomas said. \"We\u0027re delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\" Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings. \"When a clinic can\u0027t process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\" Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits. \"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won\u0027t, and we\u0027ll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\" Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover. \"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can\u0027t absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\" Funding frozen, oversight halted With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving. \"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won\u0027t have enough money to stay open.\" The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines. Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\" \"If there aren\u0027t people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn\u0027t working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\" Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people\u0027s reproductive health for decades.\" Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that\u0027s how a system collapses.\" What can still be done According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs. Some states — California, New Mexico, Washington — are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale. \"Private donors can\u0027t replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can\u0027t crowdfund your way to a working health system.\" Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA\u0027s staffing, but without administrators in place, money can\u0027t reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access. \"This isn\u0027t a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It\u0027s women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\" More from CBS News Wisconsin Planned Parenthood resumes abortions after pause Newark Liberty delays caused by government shutdown, Duffy says 2 Illinois National Guard members speak out: \"I won\u0027t turn against my neighbors\" New lawsuits filed against Rochester Hills doctor over alleged sexual abuse Lavonia Hospital closes labor and delivery unit In: United States Department of Health and Human Services © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Experts say it\u0027s not as simple as left and right. By Joe Walsh Joe Walsh Senior Editor, Politics Joe Walsh is a senior editor for digital politics at CBS News. Joe previously covered breaking news for Forbes and local news in Boston. Read Full Bio Joe Walsh October 27, 2025 / 4:09 PM EDT / CBS News It\u0027s a bipartisan problem in a country beset by polarization: Since the start of 2025, political violence has killed, injured or threatened conservative and liberal political figures alike. This month, a pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to \"eliminate\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City, and a Minnesota man was charged with offering a $45,000 bounty for Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest in a jarring trend of threats and violent acts against political figures. In September, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on a Utah college campus. Afterwards, the alleged shooter told his roommate, \"some hate can\u0027t be negotiated out,\" according to court documents. Three months earlier in Minnesota, Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed at home, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were shot on the same night. Two months before that, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u0027s home was set on fire while he and his family slept. Also this year: Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in D.C. were fatally shot, a Republican Party of New Mexico office was targeted in an arson attack, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities were shot at and a California fertility clinic was bombed, among other violent incidents. And before that, President Trump survived two attempts on his life and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u0027s husband was beaten with a hammer at home. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s would-be assassin walked in front of his home, but then had second thoughts, called an emergency line and admitted traveling to Maryland to kill a Supreme Court justice. The trend has drawn a divided response. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused the \"radical left\" of fomenting violence, while Democrats argue that right-wing extremism is a problem, too. But while some of these perpetrators may have claimed political rationales for their violent acts, it\u0027s hard to argue any of them were adherents to a cohesive political cause. They were mostly lone actors driven by personal gripes, researchers who study political violence say — so some experts suggest the frame of partisan politics may not be the best way of understanding the problem. \"The rush to assign blame to the traditional binary of left versus right politically, I think, is an exercise in futility,\" said Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University\u0027s Program on Extremism, \"because it\u0027s much more complicated than that a lot of times.\" \"Salad bar extremism\" There\u0027s some research on the political motives of violent acts. One report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found right-wing terrorism has been more common than left-wing terrorism in the U.S. over the last decade, but this year, left-wing incidents are on track to take the lead for the first time in over 30 years. It\u0027s difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from this report because the total number of acts of terrorism has dropped. From 2016 through last year, there were an average of 22.7 attacks and plots from the right and four from the left annually, while in the first half of this year, there were five left-wing incidents and just one on the right. Many people who carry out political violence have views that are tough to pin down, or they hold a mix of beliefs that don\u0027t align with either side of the partisan divide. Take the bombing at a Southern California fertility clinic that injured four people in May. Authorities say the perpetrator — who died in the attack — appeared to believe in \"anti-natalism\" and \"pro-mortalism,\" a set of obscure philosophies that argue it\u0027s wrong to bring children into the world against their will, or that view death as preferable to life. \"Not only are the people carrying out this violence not stooges of a political party or affiliated with the political parties, they\u0027re not really affiliated with the mainstream political ideologies that either espouses,\" said Kieran Doyle, North America research manager at the Armed Conflict Location \u0026 Event Data Project, which tracks political violence globally. Some violent actors hold \"a hodgepodge of different, sometimes apparently contradictory, political motivations,\" said Doyle, who called that phenomenon \"salad bar extremism.\" In some cases, the perpetrators\u0027 motives are hazy. Baumgartner pointed to Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shot at Mr. Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania last year, grazing the then-presidential candidate\u0027s ear and killing a rallygoer before he was fatally shot by the Secret Service. The 20-year-old\u0027s motives and political leanings are shrouded in mystery — he searched online for information about both Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News last year. And in other cases, perpetrators of violence have no obvious ideology at all. FBI Director Kash Patel testified earlier this month that a large share of the bureau\u0027s domestic terror probes are focused on a category called \"nihilistic violent extremism,\" which he defined as violent acts that are \"motivated by a deep hatred of society.\" \"The reasons why they\u0027re carrying out these attacks are not inherently political,\" Baumgartner said of nihilistic extremists, which he said includes some recent school shooters in Nashville and Minneapolis. \"They are not doing it to further some political, religious, ethnonationalist … cause. They\u0027re just doing it for the sake of committing an act of violence.\" Violence dominated by lone wolves with personalized motives Perpetrators of violence also rarely belong to organized groups with clear goals and motives, experts say. Cionadh Raleigh, CEO of the Armed Conflict Location \u0026 Event Data Project, told CBS News that violent acts by groups like far-right militias are on a long-term decline. \"There are many groups, but they\u0027re very inactive,\" she said. But killings or assassinations by lone actors \"have been consistently high in the States now for decades,\" said Raleigh. Baumgartner said the only recent high-profile act of political violence with an obvious link to a wider group was the July shooting at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. More than a dozen people have been arrested in connection with that shooting, and authorities say many of the defendants harbored anarchist views or beliefs in line with antifa, a loosely defined left-wing movement. One of the suspects has been described as a cult-like leader. But in general, Baumgartner said, political violence is \"primarily conducted by individuals who have a highly personalized and individualized ideology, if you can call it that.\" In some cases, these lone actors are \"deeply immersed in niche online subcultures\" and have grown alienated from society for various reasons, he said. He argues that profile fits the Trump rally shooter Crooks, alleged Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson and Dallas ICE shooter Joshua Jahn. \"They end up basically becoming irony-poisoned, and anything that is transgressive or subversive and goes against social mores is what they find appealing,\" he said. Political threats on the rise The vast majority of Americans reject political violence — one CBS News poll released earlier this month found 86% of Americans believe it\u0027s unacceptable. But threats against public officials appear to be on the rise. The U.S. Capitol Police is on track to investigate over 14,000 possible threats against lawmakers and their offices this year, Chief Michael Sullivan said last month, up from 9,474 in an already busy 2024. And the U.S. Marshals Service investigated 562 threats against federal judges in the 2025 fiscal year, up from 509 in 2024 but down from 630 in 2023. Lower-profile local politicians haven\u0027t been spared either. Princeton University\u0027s Bridging Divides Initiative recorded almost 300 instances of threats and harassment against mayors, city councilors and other local officials in the first half of 2025, up 9% year-over-year. Roudabeh Kishi, the initiative\u0027s chief research officer, said local officials \"across the spectrum\" have faced threats and violence — including those who hold nonpartisan offices. She believes politicians hold some responsibility to cool hostilities — including by avoiding baselessly casting blame. \"We really need leaders across the political spectrum to refuse calls for retribution [and] refrain from further normalizing violence,\" she said. \"Blaming whole groups of people or whole sides of the political spectrum is what really risks broader violence.\" More from CBS News Minnesota man arrested for threatening Pam Bondi in TikTok post State patrol: Threats to Minnesota officials more than doubled in last year DFL leaders hold 1st \"gun violence prevention town hall\" Charlie Kirk murder suspect can wear street clothes in court but must be restrained Meet the candidates in the special election for Texas Senate District 9 © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Combs was ordered to serve 50 months in prison — just over four years — for two prostitution-related charges earlier this month. He has been in custody since September of last year and is credited with the time served. His attorneys last week filed a notice of appeal to the Federal District Court in New York, appealing both Combs\u0027 conviction and sentence. They are expected to file more papers containing their arguments before the appeal goes to a panel of three judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. During the sentencing hearing, Combs spoke for about 12 minutes, saying that he takes \"full accountability and responsibility.\" In addressing the judge, Combs said that \"My domestic violence will be a heavy burden that I will have to carry.\" He said he makes \"no excuse because I knew better,\" claiming that he was \"sick on drugs\" and \"out of control.\" Combs\u0027 lawyers have also asked the judge to send him to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve the rest of his sentence, telling a judge early this month that the facility\u0027s drug treatment program will help him stay clean. In a letter, Combs\u0027 lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons transfer Combs from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.

Read Full Bio Nicole Sganga Updated on: October 28, 2025 / 11:21 AM EDT / CBS News Chicago — Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump\u0027s controversial immigration enforcement mission — a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks. \"It\u0027s disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois\u0027s 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\" Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops – including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard – to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area. \"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who\u0027s actively dismantling our rights — free speech, due process, freedom of the press — it\u0027s really hard to be a soldier right now.\" Undated photo: Illinois National Guard Capt. Dylan Blaha. left. Photo provided by Dylan Blaha Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment. Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\" Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn\u0027t hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\" \"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn\u0027t stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\" A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter. Undated photo: Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, Illinois National Guard, center Photo provided by Demi Palacek The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They\u0027re definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said. Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation\u0027s wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We\u0027re not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\" The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders — too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They\u0027re not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don\u0027t want to be there. They\u0027re scared, too.\" Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing. Fears for immigrant service members Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard – with 160 legal permanent residents in the state\u0027s Army National Guard and 30 in the state\u0027s Air National Guard. \"They\u0027re in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They\u0027re choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything — their legal status, their path to citizenship.\" U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs. Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo. \"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\" \"Everyone says, \u0027Why don\u0027t they do it the right way?\u0027\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said. Retribution in their ranks Both Blaha and Palecek said they\u0027ve faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\" Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She\u0027s received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said. Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said. \"Today it\u0027s Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\" Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I\u0027ve been truly proud of what I\u0027ve been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I\u0027m in the military. It\u0027s embarrassing.\" Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It\u0027s a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it\u0027s OK.\" A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump\u0027s deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide. A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago\u0027s violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita. When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\" \"They\u0027re coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors — that\u0027s vile and disgusting to me.\" The two soldiers say they\u0027re speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it\u0027s Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down.

Natasha Lazaridi/Getty Images A home equity line of credit (HELOC) offers homeowners a cost-effective way to finance a variety of projects or expenses. And, based on data released over the summer, there\u0027s plenty of money to utilize, with home equity levels recently hitting a cumulative record high in the country. With interest rates on HELOCs lower than what\u0027s available for borrowers with home equity loans, personal loans and credit cards, a HELOC is also one of the cheapest ways to borrow right now. But it\u0027s not a totally risk-free product, either. A HELOC does leverage your home\u0027s equity as needed and failure to make the agreed-upon repayments could lead to foreclosure. It also has a variable interest rate that\u0027s been steadily declining for borrowers in recent years, but because of its structure, it could make budgeting a bit more difficult compared to fixed-rate options. To better improve their chances of HELOC borrowing success, then, it may help homeowners to know the smart ways to use the line of credit, especially now in the final weeks of 2025. Below, we\u0027ll break down three smart ways to use a HELOC, specifically, before 2026. See how much home equity you\u0027d be eligible to borrow with a HELOC here. 3 smart ways to use a HELOC before 2026 Considering borrowing with a HELOC now? Here are three effective ways to have it work for you in the final months of 2025: To consolidate high-rate credit card debt The average credit card interest rate is around 21% right now. The average HELOC rate, however, is just 7.85%. That makes the latter almost three times more expensive than a HELOC. It makes sense, then, to use the HELOC to consolidate the high-rate credit card debt you\u0027re currently burdened with. By paying off the debt with the HELOC, you\u0027ll reduce the number of monthly payments you have to make to just one and it will be with an interest rate that\u0027s much more affordable, too, setting you on a more rapid path toward permanent debt relief. Just be sure to calculate your repayment costs at a variety of different interest rates (thanks to the HELOC\u0027s variable rate) to more accurately determine a realistic repayment plan. See how low your current HELOC rate offers are now. To make select home repairs and renovations Did you know that you can deduct the interest paid on a HELOC if the line of credit is used for specific home repairs and renovations? Projects like kitchen renovations, bathroom remodels, new rooms and more can all qualify for the deduction. This not only saves you money in a way that other borrowing products cannot, but it also makes concerns over the changing HELOC rate less pressing when you know that you\u0027ll be able to deduct the interest paid on the HELOC when tax season arrives anyway. Just be sure to apply for the HELOC (and use it for these projects) now, in the final two months of 2025, or your tax deduction will be delayed until it comes time to file for 2026, instead. To build a backup emergency fund Inflation has risen in the past two reports released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment is up, too. Against this backdrop, a HELOC coordinated to be used as a back-up emergency fund could make sense, especially if your home\u0027s value and available equity to leverage have increased in recent years, as it has for many. Remember, you don\u0027t need to make payments on the full HELOC line approved for, just for any amount borrowed. And full repayments won\u0027t be due until the initial draw period has concluded, as many lenders mandate interest-only payments on the HELOC to start. So this could be the smart way to boost your financial security in today\u0027s unpredictable economic climate. Just be smart in your approach, as your home equity is being leveraged here, and you don\u0027t want to borrow from it recklessly, potentially putting you in a worse financial position than where you started. The bottom line A HELOC can be a smart and functional tool for homeowners during many periods, but especially so now, in the final months of 2025. Whether it\u0027s used to consolidate high-rate credit card debt, to make specific home improvement projects, as a back-up emergency fund or for all three purposes, a HELOC offers homeowners a cost-effective way to borrow now. Just be sure to time any application carefully, as some of the features of a HELOC may be better exploited in the final months of the year (like home projects) versus being delayed into 2026.

Read Full Bio Angelica Leicht October 27, 2025 / 2:50 PM EDT / CBS News As mortgage rates continue to fall, the decline is reshaping the housing market for homebuyers. Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images After several years of painful affordability pressures, mortgage rates are finally edging lower. Case in point? Just before the Federal Reserve\u0027s September 2025 rate cut, average mortgage rates dipped to 6.13%, the lowest point for mortgage rates in the last three years. Rates then bounced back briefly in early October, only to slide again in recent weeks. As of now, 30-year conventional mortgage rates hover near 6.19% on average, and with another Fed rate cut all but expected on October 29, many lenders are already starting to price that shift into their rates. That\u0027s welcome news for would-be homebuyers, many of whom have spent years waiting out the high borrowing costs that followed the record-low mortgage rates offered during the pandemic era. And, while today\u0027s 6%-plus mortgage rates may still sound high compared to the prior 3% levels, they represent a meaningful improvement from the 7% to 8% range seen as recently as earlier this year. For many borrowers, that shift alone could make monthly mortgage loan payments significantly more manageable. Still, the effects of falling mortgage rates reach far beyond individual affordability. As rates slide, the broader housing market tends to react quickly, and not always in predictable ways. So, what should homebuyers expect the housing market impact to be as mortgage rates continue to fall? That\u0027s what we\u0027ll examine below. Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan could be today. 3 ways falling mortgage rates could impact the housing market (and homebuyers) Here are a few big ways today\u0027s rate environment could shape the housing market and what it means for those hoping to buy soon: More buyers could re-enter the market One of the most immediate effects of falling mortgage rates is a rebound in buyer demand. When borrowing costs drop, sidelined homebuyers tend to jump back into the market, hoping to take advantage of lower monthly payments and potentially lock in a cheaper long-term mortgage loan. That dynamic has already started to play out. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance and purchase applications both rose following the Fed\u0027s September cut, and a similar surge is likely to occur if the Fed follows through with another reduction this week. After all, even a small decline from 6.19% to about 6% could save buyers hundreds of dollars per month on a typical mortgage, which may be enough to sway hesitant buyers. However, that increased demand can be a double-edged sword. When more buyers flood the market at once, available inventory can tighten quickly, leading to faster price growth and more bidding wars. So, if you\u0027re ready and preapproved, acting sooner rather than later could help you get ahead of renewed competition. Compare your top mortgage loan options and lock in a rate now. Lower rates could boost home prices again As mortgage rates fall, affordability improves, but that doesn\u0027t always mean homes become cheaper. In fact, falling rates can often lead to the opposite: renewed price growth. That\u0027s because when more buyers can afford to enter the market, demand can outpace supply, putting upward pressure on prices. We\u0027ve seen that happen before, and that trend could return this fall if supply remains low. After all, many current homeowners are still locked into the ultra-low mortgage rates they secured in 2020 and 2021, which discourages them from selling. As a result, the number of homes on the market hasn\u0027t risen meaningfully in most markets, even as demand shows signs of life. If the Fed\u0027s upcoming rate cut pushes 30-year mortgage rates closer to 6% or even slightly below, price gains could accelerate through late 2025. For buyers, that means the affordability improvements from lower rates could be partially offset by higher home values, which is a frustrating paradox that\u0027s become familiar in this rate-driven market. Borrowers may gain more purchasing power While rising prices may offset some of the benefits, lower rates still translate to stronger purchasing power for most buyers. When interest costs fall, borrowers can qualify for larger loans with the same monthly payment, which is an especially important shift after several years of declining affordability. For instance, a buyer with a $2,500 monthly housing budget could afford a $410,000 home at a 6.13% rate, compared with roughly $380,000 at 7%. That extra $30,000 in purchasing power can open up more neighborhoods or property types, giving buyers more options and leverage in negotiations. This could also breathe new life into segments of the market that have stagnated. For example, with more buyers able to stretch into higher price ranges, sellers in the mid-tier and move-up home brackets may see stronger offers. Still, any meaningful shift in affordability will also depend on how quickly and how far mortgage rates actually fall. The bottom line Mortgage rates have fallen from their recent peaks and could decline a bit further following the Fed\u0027s likely October rate cut. For buyers, that could mean lower borrowing costs, more purchasing power, and, at least temporarily, an easier path to homeownership. But if demand rebounds and supply stays tight, it could also reignite competition and price pressure in an already strained market. As a result, the best move for homebuyers to make now is likely to watch the data closely, get preapproved to lock in a rate if it dips further and stay realistic about how local market conditions could evolve. Even in a falling-rate environment, timing and preparation remain important components of getting a good deal on a home. Edited by Matt Richardson © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Unfortunately, in recent years, cost-effective borrowing options have been rare. With interest rates on products like home equity loans, personal loans and credit cards all recently in the double digits (not to mention mortgages, which at one point were near their highest level since 2000), borrowers had very few affordable options to choose from. Against this backdrop, a home equity line of credit (HELOC), however, has been one of the better ways to borrow. Not only does it leverage a robust source (with the average home equity amount comfortably over $300,000 according to a report released earlier this year), but it does so with an average rate significantly lower than all of the aforementioned alternatives. And that rate is consistently declining, too. Thanks to the variable-rate nature of the product, which sees rates change monthly based on market conditions, a HELOC isn\u0027t just one of the cheaper ways to borrow equity now, it\u0027s also one of the cheaper ways to borrow money, period. To better appreciate the affordability and timeliness of this unique product, then, it helps to understand the recent trajectory HELOC rates have experienced. And it\u0027s a positive one for both existing borrowers and prospective ones. So, how low have HELOC interest rates actually dropped over the past year? That\u0027s what we\u0027ll examine below. Start by seeing how low your current HELOC rate offers are here. How low have HELOC interest rates dropped over the past year? While interest rates have cooled over the past year, thanks in large part to the Federal Reserve\u0027s interest rate reductions, the impact has been arguably felt most powerfully in the HELOC borrowing space. This is great news for existing borrowers, who see their rate adjust monthly based on market conditions without having to refinance as they would with alternative products. But the recent rate declines could also encourage potential borrowers to act, knowing that the product here is well-positioned to become more affordable over time. So, how low have HELOC interest rates dropped over the past year? Here are the average rates on a $30,000 HELOC, according to Bankrate, over the past 13 months: September 2024: 9.99% October 2024: 8.94% November 2024: 8.70% December 2024: 8.55% January 2025: 8.27% February 2025: 8.28% March 2025: 8.06%: April 2025: 7.90% May 2025: 7.99% June 2025: 8.27% July 2025: 8.27% August 2025: 8.13% September 2025: 8.90% October 2025: 7.89% In short: HELOC rates, minus a few temporary increases, have been on a long, steady decline for much of the past year. And, as of late October 2025, HELOC rates are more than two full percentage points lower than they were at the start of September 2024. If you\u0027re a homeowner with a significant amount of equity to utilize and a good-to-excellent credit score, though, you may be able to find a rate even lower than that 7.89% now. Take the time, then, to shop around, comparing rates and lenders (and remember that you don\u0027t have to use the same bank you have your mortgage with if you don\u0027t want to). Shop for low-rate HELOCs online here. The bottom line Today\u0027s low HELOC interest rates aren\u0027t an anomaly. Instead, they\u0027re a reflection of an increasingly cooling interest rate climate that homeowners in need of extra financing would be smart to take advantage of. Just be sure to calculate your repayment costs against a variety of rates, both higher and lower than what\u0027s currently available, to more accurately ensure long-term affordability.

The reporter, Miguel Angel Beltran, had previously worked in print media and was now covering crime-related issues on social media, according to local reports. Beltran\u0027s body was found on Saturday along a stretch of highway that connects the northwest state of Durango with Mazatlan, a resort hub in the neighboring state of Sinaloa, local press reported. Local media reported the journalist\u0027s body was found wrapped in a blanket, with a message that read: \"For spreading false accusations against the people of Durango.\" His death was confirmed to AFP by the Durango state prosecutor\u0027s office. Beltran had reported from TikTok accounts, under the handle Capo, and on Facebook, on the page La Gazzetta Durango, AFP confirmed. In one of his last posts, on Oct. 22, Beltran reported on the arrest of a leader of a crime gang called Cabrera Sarabia, which operates in Durango and is a rival of the powerful Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartels. Mexico is considered one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with more than 150 media workers slain since 1994, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Beltran and other murdered journalists worked in areas where drug cartels were active, and they published their work in local media or on social media, generally in precarious employment conditions. Media workers are regularly targeted in Mexico, often in direct reprisal for their work covering topics like corruption and the country\u0027s notoriously violent drug traffickers. A record number of journalists were killed worldwide in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report released earlier this year, including five in Mexico. Mexico had its deadliest year for journalists in 2022, with 13 killings, according to CPJ and Articulo 19, an organization promoting press freedom in Mexico. Since 2000, Articulo 19 has documented 174 murders and 31 disappearances of journalists in Mexico. All but a handful of media workers\u0027 killings and abductions remain unsolved. \"Impunity is the norm in crimes against the press,\" the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a 2024 report on Mexico. A report by CPJ and Amnesty International showed in 2024 that Mexico fails in its efforts to provide state-sanctioned protection to members of the press.

In addition to the flight delays, 118 flights heading into or out of the U.S. were canceled Monday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. The delays come after backups at airports over the weekend. On Sunday, more than 8,700 U.S. flights were delayed, FlightAware data shows, as air traffic controller shortages rise. Such workers are set to miss their first full paychecks on Tuesday. \"They got their notice on Thursday and Friday. They get a notice of what they are going to be paid on Tuesday. And they got a big fat no paycheck is coming on Tuesday,\" Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Sunday. \"I\u0027ve been out talking to air traffic controllers, and you can see the stress. These are people that oftentimes like paycheck to paycheck ... they are concerned about gas in the car, they are concerned about childcare,\" he added. There were 22 so-called \"staffing triggers,\" indicating personnel shortages at air traffic control towers and facilities across the U.S. on Sunday, Duffy said. \"That\u0027s a sign that the controllers are wearing thin,\" said Duffy, who anticipates higher levels of flight delays and cancellations over the coming days as staffing shortages in towers increase. The nation faced a shortage of air traffic controllers even before the government shutdown began, however the impasse threatens to interrupt efforts to ramp up staffing.

Read Full Bio Caroline Linton Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 2:44 PM EDT / CBS News Indiana\u0027s Republican governor on Monday said he would be calling a special session to consider redrawing the state\u0027s congressional map, following in the footsteps of other GOP states — although the state Senate president cautioned that \"the votes still aren\u0027t there.\" Gov. Mike Braun posted on X that he will be \"calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.\" He said the special session will work to conform \"Indiana\u0027s tax code with new federal tax provisions.\" The session is set to start on Nov. 3 and by law it can only run for 30 session days, or 40 calendar days. Indiana currently has seven Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, and the Republicans are hoping to change the district lines to edge out the two Democrats. Filing for the 2026 midterm elections begins on Jan. 7 and closes on Feb. 6, with the primaries scheduled for May 5 — which would give candidates only a few months to campaign under new district lines. Republicans have a supermajority in both chambers, but Indiana Senate President Rodric Bray\u0027s office said in a statement Monday morning that \"the votes still aren\u0027t there for redistricting.\" Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder said in a statement that Democrats will fight the \"illegitimate session with every tool, every vote and every ounce of moral clarity we have.\" President Trump won Indiana by 19 points, but there has been hesitation from Republican lawmakers on redrawing the state\u0027s congressional lines, which were set in 2021. Republican leaders have met with Mr. Trump at the White House, and Vice President JD Vance has visited Indiana at least twice and also met with Republican lawmakers in D.C. Republicans have been seeking to redistrict in red states nationwide as Mr. Trump has tried to solidify the GOP majority in the House. Over the summer, Mr. Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional maps to give the party up to five seats. That push garnered national attention, especially when Democrats in the state legislature fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum, dragging the issue into a second session until it eventually succeeded. In response, California\u0027s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, pushed an effort to redraw his state\u0027s congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats. A new map was passed by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, and it now will go before voters on Nov. 4 as a ballot measure known as Proposition 50. A CBS News poll conducted between Oct. 16 and 21 found that 62% of California voters plan to support it. Other Republican-led states have taken on redistricting efforts, even though the net outcome would just be one seat in each state. Missouri lawmakers approved a new map in September to edge out longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in Kansas City, and North Carolina followed earlier this month with the General Assembly passing a map intended to force out Rep. Don Davis. Democrats have filed lawsuits against many of these efforts. Aaron Navarro and Hunter Woodall contributed to this report.

Before joining the business and finance vertical, she worked at \"60 Minutes,\" CBSNews.com and CBS News 24/7 as part of the CBS News Associate Program. Read Full Bio Mary Cunningham Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 3:49 PM EDT / CBS News For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee. Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September. And now for the bad news. \"One of the questions that I\u0027m asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\" So what\u0027s behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics. Beef As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve data — the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy. Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows (see below). The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation\u0027s beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply. Simply, \"The problem is that there\u0027s less cows,\" Lempert said. As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA data shows. Experts say the decline in the nation\u0027s cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has found. Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert. According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025. As for beef from Brazil, America\u0027s largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Coffee The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor data shows. That\u0027s well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4. Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of La Niña, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil. Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world. \"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said. Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America, according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee. The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS. In a September report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted. Bananas Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn\u0027t immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September — the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe\u0027s announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents. As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%. Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told CNBC that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%. A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted. \"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.

Read Full Bio Sara Moniuszko October 27, 2025 / 1:01 PM EDT / CBS News The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Lynkuet, a new daily pill from Bayer that provides a non-hormonal option for treating hot flashes, common during menopause. The drug, known generically as elinzanetant, is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. Menopause occurs when the ovaries stop producing estrogen, usually in a woman\u0027s late 40s or early 50s. Treating its symptoms has long been difficult because the transition affects multiple systems — temperature regulation, sleep, mood, bones, and sexuality — and the hormonal shifts vary widely among individuals. No single therapy can address all symptoms, and many overlap with other conditions, making menopause challenging to manage. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, but it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer. Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study menopause has historically been limited. Lynkuet (pronounced LIN-kew-et) gained FDA approval on Friday after three randomized clinical trials. Data from the trials showed the pill, taken once daily, significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes and improved sleep. Here\u0027s what to know: How the drug works Falling estrogen levels can confuse the brain\u0027s internal thermostat, causing sudden heat waves, sweating and disturbed sleep in menopausal women. Lynkuet works by blocking neurokinin-3 receptors, which help regulate body temperature and sleep. By calming that signaling pathway, the medication reduces the frequency and intensity of hot flashes and related nighttime symptoms. Results from clinical trials Three large studies with more than 2,000 women who had moderate to severe hot flashes found that those who took Lynkuet once a day had about 55% fewer hot flashes after 12 weeks compared with women taking a placebo. Many women began to feel better in just two weeks, according to results published in JAMA and JAMA Internal Medicine. Lynkuet also made the hot flashes less intense and helped women sleep better and feel more rested. The pill, called Lynkuet (generic name elinzanetant) from drugmaker Bayer, is said to help treat hot flashes for menopausal women. Courtesy of Bayer Use in women with breast cancer Another trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine looked at how Lynkuet works for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were having hot flashes caused by their hormone-blocking treatment. After four weeks, women taking Lynkuet had significantly fewer hot flashes per day than those taking a placebo. They also said they slept better and felt better overall. This is important because women being treated for breast cancer usually can\u0027t take hormone therapy to manage menopause symptoms, since their cancer medicines already lower or block estrogen. The study suggests that Lynkuet could be a safe, nonhormonal option for these women, though scientists are still studying how well it works and how safe it is over time. Safety profile and side effects The most common side effects are mild tiredness, headache and sleepiness, Bayer said. Some trial participants developed elevated liver enzyme levels, a possible early sign of liver toxicity. For that reason, the FDA recommends blood tests before starting the drug and again after three months. No serious liver injuries were reported in studies lasting up to one year, but post-approval monitoring will continue. Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should avoid the medication, since animal studies suggest it could cause pregnancy loss. Why the approval matters Hot flashes affect an estimated 80% of women during menopause. For many, they last for years and interfere with sleep, concentration and daily life. Non-hormonal options, like certain antidepressants and gabapentin, can help some women but are often less effective. Lynkuet offers a different approach by targeting the biological mechanism that drives hot flashes. Its approval broadens treatment choices for menopausal symptoms, particularly for women who cannot or prefer not to use hormones. Availability and cost Lynkuet will be available in U.S. pharmacies starting in November 2025 with a prescription. Bayer said the list price will be about $625 per month, though insured patients could pay as little as $25 a month through savings programs. Menopause is a universal experience, yet treatment options remain limited. The approval of Lynkuet adds a new choice for managing hot flashes and night sweats without hormones. While ongoing studies will determine its long-term safety and effectiveness, the drug represents a meaningful advance in care for women navigating this stage of life.

A love song through time In Houston, Texas, Jerome and Agnes Bourgeois have found a timeless way to celebrate 66 years of marriage. Each anniversary, Jerome serenades his wife, a tradition that\u0027s become even more meaningful with time. \"I\u0027ll try to sing through \u0027Wind Beneath My Wings\u0027 without falling apart,\" he said. Their love story began in 1959, when Agnes married Jerome, who had just $90 to his name. She supported him through college as he worked his way up to become a music teacher, a principal, and eventually a school superintendent. About 10 years ago, Agnes was diagnosed with vascular dementia. Since then, Jerome has been her full-time caretaker. \"From her being the wind beneath my wings, I have become her provider and caregiver,\" he said. When vocal cord atrophy later threatened to take away his ability to sing, Jerome, 91, said he felt lost. \"It made me feel kind of lonely, because I always had that voice as a partner,\" he said. Determined not to give up, he spent seven months in therapy at TIRR Memorial Hermann to regain his voice. That perseverance paid off during their most recent anniversary. Jerome sang to Agnes once again, his voice sparking brief but joyful moments of recognition. As he finished his serenade, Agnes smiled and replied softly, \"I love you, so it\u0027s okay.\" A joke with a purpose In Louisiana, 9-year-old Nora Vaughn has turned laughter into a mission of love. Her 14-year-old sister, Susie, was diagnosed with Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with no known cure, at age 3, inspiring Nora to take action. \"I was raising money for Rett syndrome because I want her to be able to talk, walk stably, and use her hands,\" Nora said. Her mother, Erin, described the deep bond between the sisters. \"They\u0027re two little goofballs,\" she said. \"She really makes Susie laugh like nobody else can and is such a comfort to her.\" She said that together they confront the daily challenges they face. \"It affects everything,\" she said. \"We feed her, we bathe her, we take her to the toilet. She can walk a little, but you have to be around her to make sure that she\u0027s not gonna suddenly fall.\" At a school event, Nora even thanked Susie for letting her make her laugh, saying it made her feel better, too. To support her cause, Nora set up a joke stand in her front yard, complete with a QR code for donations to the Rett Syndrome Research Trust. Her repertoire of jokes, from \"What do you call a dog magician? A Labra-cadabra-dor!\" to \"What did the mommy volcano say to the baby volcano? I lava you,\" has helped her raise nearly $1,000 for research.

Read Full Bio Angelica Leicht October 27, 2025 / 12:41 PM EDT / CBS News If you suspect some of your old debts are in collections, there are ways to locate them and settle them for good. Artisteer/Getty Images If you\u0027ve fallen behind on your bills or have stopped making payments altogether, there\u0027s a good chance one or more of your accounts could now be in collections. Many people are dealing with this issue right now, thanks to high interest rates causing balances to grow, rising costs causing budgets to be stretched and a generally tough economic landscape that\u0027s having a wide impact on millions of Americans. And, if you\u0027re one of them, figuring out exactly which accounts are impacted and who holds them now can feel like a monumental task. After all, a lot can happen between defaulting on a debt and it landing in the hands of a debt collector. Not only do the original creditors sell debts to third parties, but those unpaid debts can be sold between debt collection agencies, too. As a result, it\u0027s common for accounts you\u0027ve forgotten about to reappear years later with new contact info and higher balances. That can make it difficult to get a full picture of your financial situation, especially if you\u0027re trying to rebuild your credit or qualify for a mortgage, car loan or an apartment rental. And, even one overlooked collection account can damage your credit score and derail those plans. But the good news? You can track down every outstanding account, verify its accuracy and start working toward a resolution. Find out how you can start getting rid of your overwhelming debt now. How do I find all of my accounts in collections? There\u0027s no single list that shows all your outstanding collections, but there are several reliable tools that can help you piece together the full picture. Here\u0027s what to do: Check your credit reports from all three bureaus The easiest way to start is with your credit reports from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, which can be accessed for free at AnnualCreditReport.com. Not every collection agency reports to all three bureaus, so it\u0027s essential to check all of your reports, not just one. As you review each of your reports, look specifically for accounts listed under \"collections\" or \"negative items.\" These entries will typically show the original creditor, the collection agency that now owns the debt, the amount owed and the date it was reported. Learn about the debt relief options you can use to get your finances back on track. Look for unfamiliar collection agencies Sometimes, a debt might not appear under the original creditor\u0027s name, but under a debt buyer\u0027s name you don\u0027t recognize instead. If you see a company like \"Midland Credit Management\" or \"Portfolio Recovery Associates,\" that\u0027s a sign the account was sold or transferred at some point. Review recent mail, emails and phone calls Federal law requires debt collectors to send you a written notice, called a debt validation letter, within five days of first contacting you. So, if you\u0027ve received calls or mail from a company trying to collect a balance, that\u0027s another way to identify what\u0027s in collections. These letters and emails are important because they can help verify who now owns the debt, as well as what you currently owe for not just the balance, but the fees and interest charges, too. Contact your original creditors If you have an account that you know is delinquent, but it\u0027s not showing up on your credit report, call the original creditor directly to get more information. They can tell you whether your account was sold to a collection agency and, if it was, provide contact details for the new owner. Use reputable debt lookup services carefully There are online services that claim to find all your debts, but use caution, as these services can also be scams. Stick with official credit reporting agencies or federally approved sources whenever possible, and you should never provide personal details like your Social Security number or bank account info to an unverified site. How to settle your debt collection accounts now Once you\u0027ve identified your outstanding debt collection accounts, the next step is resolving them. There are several paths to consider, including: Negotiate directly with the collection agency If you can afford a lump-sum payment, you might be able to negotiate and settle the debt for less than the full amount owed. Many collectors are willing to accept a fraction of the balance to close the account, especially if it\u0027s been delinquent for a while. Just be sure to always get any settlement agreement in writing before sending a payment. Set up a payment plan If paying in full isn\u0027t possible, ask about setting up an installment plan. Some agencies will allow you to make monthly payments, though interest or fees may continue to accrue during that time. This can be a good option if you want to gradually rebuild your credit while getting out of debt. Work with a debt relief company on settlement If you have multiple debts in collections and can\u0027t manage them on your own, enrolling in a debt settlement program offered by a reputable debt relief company can help. The goal of these programs is to negotiate with creditors on your behalf to reduce your overall balance in return for a lump sum payment, and the relief you get can be substantial. Consider credit counseling or a debt management plan Credit counseling agencies can help you organize your debts, create a repayment plan and sometimes lower your interest rates. While this approach doesn\u0027t reduce your total balance, it can simplify repayment and help you get current with creditors. The bottom line Finding all of your accounts in collections is a critical first step toward financial recovery. Once you know exactly who you owe and how much, you can start taking control, whether that means negotiating directly, entering a debt relief program or getting help from a credit counselor. Each resolved account gets you closer to a clean slate and a higher credit score, so the sooner you identify and address your collections, the sooner you can move forward.

The jerky was shipped to Costco and Sam\u0027s Club retail locations nationwide, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u0027s Food Safety and Inspection Service said Friday. It was recalled by LSI, Inc., a South Dakota company. The recalled products include 14.5-oz. and 16-oz. plastic pouches containing \"GOLDEN ISLAND fire-grilled PORK JERKY Korean BARBECUE recipe\" with an establishment number \"M279A\" inside the USDA mark of inspection and \"best by\" dates ranging from Oct. 23, 2025, through Sept. 23, 2026. The USDA\u0027s website contains a complete list of the specific product lot codes and best-by dates subject to recall. The problem was discovered after multiple consumer complaints about finding pieces of wiry metal in the product, which the company determined originated from the conveyor belt used in production, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. No injuries have been reported, but officials urged consumers not to eat the recalled jerky. \"This product should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,\" the Food Safety and Inspection Service said, adding that people with questions can contact the company at info@goldenislandjerky.com. Over the weekend, Hormel Foods issued a recall of nearly 4.9 million pounds of frozen boneless chicken products after consumers reported finding metal in the products. Earlier this year, a company recalled more than 1,000 pounds of fully cooked frozen ground beef due to possible contamination with metal.

The fish, named Arnie after Australia\u0027s recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin. Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months. The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through. \"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin. Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home. Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish\u0027s travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago. \"We\u0027ve been working on these species for decades ... and we haven\u0027t come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\" Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria\u0027s department of energy, environment and climate action. The fish — not related to ocean cod species — can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government\u0027s survey of Australian fish stocks. \"Muzza\", Sydney Aquarium\u0027s resident one-meter long Murray Cod fish, waits to be fed on November 7, 2011. GREG WOOD/AFP via Getty Images \"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it\u0027s a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said. The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes. Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia\u0027s Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species\u0027 populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing. \"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\" More from CBS News Mother and son found safely after going missing near Echo Lake Pig kidney removed from New Hampshire man who set world record Atlantans worried for family caught in Hurricane Melissa\u0027s path Flood watch in effect as new round of scattered storms expected to hit North Texas Sewage pollutes waterways in Philadelphia and South Jersey, report says In: Australia © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

She regularly appears on CBS News 24/7 to discuss her reporting. Read Full Bio Megan Cerullo Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 9:14 PM EDT / CBS News Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved. Roughly 1.4 million federal employees whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are hunkering down and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday. Here\u0027s what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends. Do all federal workers get back pay? Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee\u0027s standard rate of pay.\" Legal challenges However, a draft memo from the White House\u0027s Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we\u0027re talking about.\" Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\" Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers. \"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News. The memo also contradicts previous guidance published in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. \"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency\u0027s notice read. However, an updated version of guidelines strikes that language. \"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance. The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News\u0027 question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends. When would back pay arrive? The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\" Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\" Federal workers\u0027 last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon. What about government contractors? In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay. \"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said. They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded. What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown? Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet. Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo. When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.

She writes and edits national news, health stories, explainers and more. Read Full Bio Nicole Brown Chau Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 12:02 PM EDT / CBS News A nonprofit organization in Alaska has rescued at least 180 dogs — and a turtle — after flooding devastated several remote villages in Alaska earlier this month. Hundreds of people were airlifted out of the villages that were hit by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, but many dogs had to be left behind. The villages, most on the western coast of Alaska, have no road access, which means everything needs to flown in and out, including pets. That has been the biggest challenge for Bethel Friends of Canines, or BFK9, as the organization continues rescues, said Jenna Stewart, the nonprofit\u0027s director of development. BFK9, which started as an animal rescue in 2011, is based in Bethel, Alaska, a hub for the villages in the region. \"We are thankful to have so many pilots and airlines that help us,\" Stewart said in an email. \"It is hard for people outside of Alaska, and even some in Alaska, to fathom not being able to just drive and save these dogs.\" Bethel Friends of Canines has depended on pilots to help them get dogs out of the Alaska villages affected by the flooding. Bethel Friends of Canines BFK9, which typically takes in about 500 animals a year, has also gotten help from some people who stayed behind. In Kipnuk, one of the hard-hit villages, a group of teachers and others rounded up dogs to transfer to the rescuers, who arrived with airline kennels. \"The first dogs they sent in to us arrived in a plastic tote and a couple puppies in a Spiderman backpack,\" Stewart said. \"They had nothing else to hold these dogs, but knew they had to get out of the Village and to safety with BFK9.\" A group of puppies was transferred to Bethel Friends of Canines in a Spiderman backpack. Bethel Friends of Canines While nearly all the rescues are of dogs, the group also rescued its first turtle — a red-eared slider turtle that was a classroom pet in one of the villages. \"The turtle is now in Bethel with a local veterinarian,\" Stewart said. The group will take in cats as well, but there aren\u0027t many in rural Alaska, Steward said. They usually only get three to five cats a year, she said. After BFK9 gets the dogs to Bethel, they work to reunite them with their families. \"These Villages are pretty small, which means usually everyone knows everyone\u0027s dog,\" Stewart said. If a dog\u0027s owner is unknown, the group posts pictures on its Facebook page. Foster homes are also available if owners can\u0027t take their dogs right away. Three of the dogs rescued by Bethel Friends of Canines following devastating flooding in Alaska. Bethel Friends of Canines As of Friday, BFK9 was still getting information about more dogs that needed rescuing. \"A lot of these dogs left out there are the scared ones. They are so scared, and so confused and are hiding,\" Stewart said. \"This ordeal is far from over,\" she said. BFK9 has partnered with other groups, including the Humane World of Animals, Best Friends Animal Rescue and the August Fund in Anchorage, to help rescue and hold the dogs while they wait to be reunited. The nonprofit has received donations and support from people across Alaska and around the country. \"Bethel Friends of Canines has an incredible Village. We are doing great things, but we couldn\u0027t do it without all the people helping us,\" Stewart said.

The post targeting Bondi was reported to the FBI on Oct. 9 by a TikTok user in Detroit and features a photo of Bondi with a \"sniper-scope red dot\" on her forehead, as well as the text \"WANTED: Pam Bondi. REWARD: 45,000. DEAD OR ALIVE (PREFERABLY DEAD), according to an FBI affidavit submitted with the federal court in Minnesota. The post includes a caption that reads \"*cough cough* when they don\u0027t serve us then what?\" according to court filings. The FBI traced the account to Tyler Maxon Avalos, a 30-year-old living in St. Paul, Minnesota, it said in the affidavit. The bureau alleges that the account includes ties to anarchism, including a display name that features a symbol of anarchy and a pinned link to an \"Anarchist FAQ\" book. Avalos has a criminal history that includes a 2022 felony stalking conviction and 2016 misdemeanor domestic assault conviction in Minnesota, and 2016 felony third-degree domestic battery conviction in Florida, according to court papers. Avalos made an initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Minneapolis earlier this month and was released on a personal recognizance bond last week.

PeilingLeeCopyright/Getty Images The price of gold has more than doubled since the start of 2024. The precious metal was trading around $2,000 per ounce at the start of last year, and recently crossed the $4,000 mark before surging to above $4,300 per ounce— a level that seemed distant just months ago. While the price has moderated somewhat in the time since, price upticks will likely continue to occur, at least in the near future, as today\u0027s economic climate makes gold a smart bet for a lot of investors. And, not only has there been aggressive buying by central banks, but issues like high inflation and currency instability are also driving individual investors to hedge and diversify with gold. The next price milestone investors are watching is $5,000 per ounce, as gold\u0027s recent momentum helps that target look achievable. The question is what needs to happen economically to get it there — and how soon it may occur. Find out how you can use gold to help diversify and protect your portfolio today. Here\u0027s when the price of gold could hit $5,000 per ounce, according to experts Brandon Aversano, CEO of precious metals buyer The Alloy Market, puts the timeline for gold to hit the $5,000 per ounce price point at 18 to 24 months. \"It\u0027s not a matter of if, it\u0027s when,\" Aversano says, noting that the key drivers are already in motion. That timeframe assumes current economic trends continue at their present pace. But if economic conditions worsen quickly, the move could happen much faster. Ben Nadelstein, head of content at gold yield marketplace Monetary Metals, says gold could reach $5,000 within 12 months \"if we see negative real yields, a clear policy shift toward easier financial conditions, a weaker dollar, firm central bank demand and sustained geopolitical risk.\" Recent price action suggests even those timelines might be conservative. Just a month ago, gold was trading below $3,700 per ounce. Today it\u0027s over $4,000. \"Gold is only about 20% off from reaching $5,000, and gold just moved almost 30% in three months,\" says Brett Elliott, director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX). Given that momentum, Elliott thinks all bets are off. The path gold takes to $5,000 per ounce, though, will depend on the economic catalysts and how forcefully they move markets. Explore the benefits of gold investing and add the precious metal to your portfolio now. What needs to happen for gold to reach $5,000 per ounce? There are a few economic factors that could push gold prices to $5,000, experts say, including: Federal Reserve policy shifts The Fed has already started cutting rates and winding down quantitative tightening. \"If the Fed signals it\u0027s done fighting inflation while debt keeps climbing, gold will move sharply higher,\" says Aversano. Geopolitical instability Wars, trade disputes or financial crises can all drive investors toward safe-haven assets like gold. And, as Aversano points out, gold is already near record highs without any major crisis. \"It wouldn\u0027t take much more pressure to push it over the edge,\" he says. Declining confidence in fiat currency With deficits around 6% and debt climbing, investors are questioning whether traditional currencies can hold their value. The government is \"only going to make matters worse as they continue to debase the currency, which adds to gold\u0027s floor on a fundamental level,\" Elliott says. Financial system instability Bank failures or financial scares increase demand for high-quality collateral like gold. Nadelstein says renewed liquidity support for weak financial institutions or credible stability concerns could be major catalysts. Inflation tolerance If policymakers become more accepting of elevated inflation, it would signal a shift toward easier financial conditions, according to Nadelstein. Historically, this kind of environment benefits gold prices. Could investing in alternatives like silver pay off right now? For investors who feel priced out of gold at current levels, alternative metals, like silver, can offer several advantages, including: Lower entry point: Silver provides similar inflation protections as gold but at a lower cost, according to Aversano. Dual demand sources: \"Silver can help diversify a portfolio because it has both monetary and industrial demand,\" Nadelstein says. This can make it more resilient across different economic conditions. Bigger percentage gains: \"Silver is still undervalued relative to gold and it tends to move later in the cycle,\" notes Aversano. \"Historically, its upside percentage moves are bigger once the momentum starts.\" Supply constraints: Elliott points to six years of supply deficits, high lease rates and regional inventory dislocations as factors that could support higher silver prices ahead. The bottom line Gold may reach $5,000 in the next year, but it could also take longer. Investors have a few ways to gain exposure now, though, if they want to capitalize on the possibility of future gold price increases. Physical gold bars and coins, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gold mining stocks are all options, but it\u0027s important to weigh the benefits and downsides of each option before investing. \"Each form of investment has its own properties, advantages and risks that make it suitable for different investment goals,\" Elliott emphasizes.

The post targeting Bondi was reported to the FBI on Oct. 9 by a TikTok user in Detroit and features a photo of Bondi with a \"sniper-scope red dot\" on her forehead, as well as the text \"WANTED: Pam Bondi. REWARD: 45,000. DEAD OR ALIVE (PREFERABLY DEAD), according to an FBI affidavit submitted with the federal court in Minnesota. The post includes a caption that reads \"*cough cough* when they don\u0027t serve us then what?\" according to court filings. The FBI traced the account to Tyler Maxon Avalos, a 30-year-old living in St. Paul, Minnesota, it said in the affidavit. The bureau alleges that the account includes ties to anarchism, including a display name that features a symbol of anarchy and a pinned link to an \"Anarchist FAQ\" book. Avalos has a criminal history that includes a 2022 felony stalking conviction and 2016 misdemeanor domestic assault conviction in Minnesota, and 2016 felony third-degree domestic battery conviction in Florida, according to court papers. Avalos made an initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Minneapolis earlier this month and was released on a personal recognizance bond last week. The case was first reported by Seamus Hughes of the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

It\u0027s not clear if he had the MRI for preventative reasons or if there was a specific concern that prompted the scan. The president was asked if he received an MRI as a part of the \"advanced imaging\" his physician said he received at Walter Reed. \"I did, I got an MRI, it was perfect, yep,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, en route to Tokyo during his Asia tour, adding, \"I gave you the full results. We had an MRI and the machine, you know, the whole thing, and it was perfect.\" Asked what the doctors were looking for, Mr. Trump responded, \"You could ask the doctors. In fact, we have doctors traveling with us.

Sean Barbarella, said in a memo after Mr. Trump\u0027s checkup that he was in excellent health and his cardiac age \"was found to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age.\" Barbabella said the president underwent \"advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments,\" adding that \"comprehensive laboratory studies performed in conjunction with the visit were exceptional, including stable metabolic, hematologic, and cardiac parameters.\" More from CBS News Wisconsin Planned Parenthood resumes abortions after pause 2 Illinois National Guard members speak out: \"I won\u0027t turn against my neighbors\" State patrol: Threats to Minnesota officials more than doubled in last year North Texans fear going hungry as shutdown halts food assistance Pennsylvania representative Anita Kulik retiring at the end of her term In: Donald Trump © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the French news agency AFP that the violence around El-Fasher, the last city in the Darfur region not held by the Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries, \"represents a terrible escalation in the conflict.\" \"The level of suffering that we are witnessing in Sudan is unbearable,\" he said. Reports circulating on social media on Sunday said RSF forces had taken control of the Sudanese Armed Forces\u0027 6th Division Headquarters in El-Fasher. A desk bearing signs of shelling is seen in a school where displaced people were sheltering, in El-Fasher, Sudan, Oct. 7, 2025. Mohyaldeen M Abdallah/REUTERS The Yale School of Public Health\u0027s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which has monitored the war, said it was able to confirm from satellite imagery that RSF forces launched a major attack on El-Fasher on Sunday. The HRL said there was \"evidence of close-quarter battle\" in the city, and that the \"activity \"may be consistent with reporting that RSF has taken prisoners in and around the [army] airfield.\" The Yale lab said it would continue to monitor satellite imagery for any evidence of \"mass atrocities\" committed in El-Fasher. The RSF claimed in a statement to have taken full control of the city, but the army said fighting continued, and independent analysts said the claim could not be verified. A satellite photo provided by Planet Labs PBC shows the area around the headquarters of the Sudanese military\u0027s 6th Division in el-Fasher, Sudan, Oct. 26, 2025. Planet Labs PBC/AP The U.N. has called for civilians trapped inside the Sudanese city - of whom there are believed to be some 250,000 - to be allowed to leave. U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called for a ceasefire in the town to allow people to flee. The RSF forces have encircled El-Fasher for weeks, building an earthen berm around the city to stop supplies getting in and people getting out. It is the last remaining stronghold of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region, and if the RSF does fully capture El-Fasher, it would leave the group in control of all five of Darfur\u0027s states. Analysts have warned that the RSF has indicated it would move to formally partition Sudan and set up a parallel government in the areas under its control. An infographic created on March 27, 2025 shows the area held by the Sudanese army, in green, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), in orange, which includes most of the Darfur region, apart from the city of El-Fasher in North Darfur state. Omar Zaghloul/Anadolu/Getty Unverified images posted on social media appeared to show RSF fighters walking among bodies and injured civilians as fighters celebrated inside El-Fasher on Sunday. Fighting has raged around El-Fasher for 18 months, leaving tens of thousands of trapped residents starved of every necessity from food to medical supplies, and with little means of communicating with the outside world. From the few witness accounts to emerge, it\u0027s been clear that drone and artillery strikes have become a part of daily life as the army and RSF battled over the city. Sudan\u0027s civil war broke out in April 2023, when a power sharing agreement between commanders of the army and the RSF collapsed over plans to combine their forces. Fighting has raged ever since, and both sides have been accused of suspected war crimes as the fighting fuels what the U.N. considers the world\u0027s single largest humanitarian crisis.

BangWan/Abu Hanifah/Getty Images All eyes will turn toward the Federal Reserve this week as the central bank holds its penultimate meeting of 2025 to determine monetary policy and the future of interest rates. The bank issued a rate cut in its last meeting in September, its first of the year. That followed a pause for most of 2025 after the central bank cut rates three times in the final months of 2024. As of Monday morning, there was around a 97% chance the Fed would cut rates again in this week\u0027s meeting, according to the CME Group\u0027s FedWatch tool. While the expectation is that the federal funds rate will be reduced by 25 basis points, any relief here will help borrowers, even indirectly. And that\u0027s especially true for homebuyers, some of whom have been contending with the highest mortgage rates on record in decades over the past few years. And while the Fed doesn\u0027t directly dictate what rates lenders offer borrowers, it does go a long way toward impacting them. But will mortgage interest rates actually drop after this week\u0027s Fed meeting? Or should borrowers expect them to hold steady a bit longer? Those are the questions we\u0027ll examine below. Start by seeing how low your current mortgage interest rate offers are here. Will mortgage interest rates drop after this week\u0027s Fed meeting? The answer to this simple question is a bit more nuanced than it may seem on paper, and the timing may not align neatly enough to occur at the conclusion of the meeting on October 29. All one has to do is look at recent mortgage interest rate history to see that mortgage rates drop around the time of a Fed rate cut, but not always right after, and not necessarily by the same amount the Fed reduced rates by. For example, mortgage interest rates fell to a two-year low in September 2024, a few hours before the Fed actually issued a larger-than-anticipated 50 basis point reduction at the time. And that same dynamic played out almost exactly one year later. When the central bank cut rates by 25 basis points last month, mortgage interest rates had already declined that morning to their lowest level in three years. So, yes, mortgage interest rates could drop in connection with this week\u0027s Fed meeting, but that could occur preemptively, before the cut is issued. That\u0027s largely because lenders don\u0027t need the Fed to formally act to get ahead of that decision by reducing their offers. Many have already \"priced in\" this reduction, and that\u0027s why some borrowers may not see much of a material difference between the rates they see listed on online marketplaces today … and what they see on those same websites in the days following a cut. Keep an eye out, then, for timely (and fleeting) opportunities to lock in a low mortgage interest rate this week. And remember that after the two aforementioned rate drops, there were increases in the rate climate both times. So, if you find a low, affordable rate available this week, even if not quite as ideal as you\u0027d have hoped for, consider locking it in anyway. You never know when these opportunities will present themselves again, and you can always refinance if and when they do. Compare mortgage rates and lenders online to learn more. What\u0027s been happening with mortgage interest rates lately? Overall, rates have been on a slow but noticeable decline for all of 2025. Mortgage rates were averaging just 6.13% in mid-September alongside the Fed\u0027s rate-cutting action at the time. They then rose later in the month as data items that would normally influence the rate trajectory were either delayed or paused amid the ongoing government shutdown. But in recent weeks, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage term has again declined. That was 6.34% on October 2, 6.30% on October 9, 6.27% on October 16 and 6.19% on October 23, according to FreddieMac. So rates here are heading in the right, downward direction for borrowers. And they could fall again, not only this week but in the final weeks of the year, too, as projections surrounding another Fed rate cut when the bank meets for the last time in 2025 in December are also elevated. The bottom line Mortgage interest rates can potentially drop after this week\u0027s Fed meeting, or they could fall right before it, depending on the lender in question and their response to Fed rate activity. Some other lenders, however, may have already taken the step to adjust their offers to reflect a rate cut this week. Be ready to shop around for lenders and rates, however, as offers could be significantly different from lender to lender. And be prepared to lock in a below-average rate if found. As recent history illustrates, these opportunities may not last for very long. Edited by Angelica Leicht © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

In the election widely seen as a referendum on self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" Milei\u0027s past two years in office, which have included corruption scandals and the scrapping of tens of thousands of public jobs, his right-wing La Libertad Avanza party won more than 40% of the votes, compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts\u0027 projections. Milei, a key ideological ally of President Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, three seats short of a congressional majority.

Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\" Trump vowed to stay \"with him\" — if Milei won the votes An Argentine legislative election has likely rarely generated so much interest in Washington, or on Wall Street. Mr. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina\u0027s central bank, and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks, on a good showing for Milei in the national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory. \"If he wins we\u0027re staying with him, and if he doesn\u0027t win, we\u0027re gone,\" Mr. Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Those comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina\u0027s bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei\u0027s reforms, and analysts predicted a tight midterm race. To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Then, in an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the international credit line. In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday. \"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" Marcelo J. García, the America\u0027s director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, told The Associated Press. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023.\" Trump lauds Milei, who calls him \"a great friend\" of Argentina The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei\u0027s painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the political outsider inherited in late 2023. Mr. Trump, during a flight to Japan on Monday, said on his Truth Social network that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job.\" \"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Mr. Trump wrote. Milei responded to the post, calling the U.S. president \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\" Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Mr. Trump for his role in helping Milei at the polls.

EMILIANO LASALVIA/AFP/Getty Kicillof warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei\u0027s cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy. \"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\" \"The situation is getting worse and worse\" Sunday\u0027s outcome will test public patience for Milei\u0027s cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although his budget cuts have slashed inflation — from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month — consumer price increases still outpace salaries and pensions. The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei\u0027s reforms and those who say they\u0027re struggling to make ends meet like never before. In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment. But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina\u0027s Riachuelo River, Epifanía Contreras, 64, told the AP that she as though she was bearing the brunt of the federal budget cuts. \"You can\u0027t live on 290,000 pesos a month with today\u0027s inflation,\" she said, describing how her monthly pension, worth about $200, has shriveled in value as a result of austerity measures. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\" More than 250,000 jobs have been lost since Milei came to power, with around 18,000 businesses closing, according to an analysis published this month by the Center for Argentine Political Economy think tank, as the right-wing administration froze investment in infrastructure, health care, education and other social services. Voting is compulsory for adults in Argentina, but electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% on Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation\u0027s return to democracy in 1983. \"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei\u0027s strong exchange rate, told the AP. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We\u0027re just choosing the lesser evil.\" More from CBS News Newsom says he will consider White House run after 2026 elections Rally, march held in Little Village in protest of Trump, federal agents Wisconsin Planned Parenthood resumes abortions after pause Ann Arbor Police roll out new transparency dashboard Stanislaus County food pantries brace for spike in demand as SNAP benefits expire In: Donald Trump Trump Administration Election Latin America Argentina Javier Milei © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Read Full Bio Kaia Hubbard Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 8:08 PM EDT / CBS News Follow live updates on the shutdown for Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025, here. See earlier developments below. What to know about Day 27 of the government shutdown: Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the government shutdown, the second-longest funding lapse in history at 28 days. The largest union representing federal government employees said that \"it\u0027s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" increasing pressure on Democrats to back down. Federal employees missed their first full paycheck at the end of last week. At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he wasn\u0027t \"100% sure\" whether members of the military would get paid this week. Federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, the Department of Agriculture said, warning that \"the well has run dry\" for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits to help buy food. The Senate reconvened in the afternoon but did not vote on a House-passed measure to fund the government. The bill failed to advance for a 12th time last week. New Updates 8:08 PM \"People are scared\" as SNAP benefits face looming halt More than 40 million Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to pay for groceries are facing uncertainty as benefits are expected to come to a halt Saturday. \"People are scared,\" said Central Pennsylvania Food Bank CEO Shila Ulrich, who expects demand to pick up. \"It\u0027s a moment where people don\u0027t know and understand what\u0027s about to happen, whether or not they\u0027ll get those benefits should the government open back up, or when.\" Erin Annis — who uses SNAP benefits after three bouts of cancer and a double knee replacement left her unable to work — told CBS News that she\u0027ll need to rely on help from her children if assistance is cut off. \"That\u0027s an awful feeling,\" she said. \"For them to have to help me … it\u0027s a little tough to think about sometimes.\" The U.S. Department of Agriculture says \"the well will run dry\" for SNAP benefits, often known as food stamps, due to the government shutdown. The department says it will not tap into a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to keep SNAP payments flowing, arguing that money is reserved for natural disasters. The Trump administration has blamed Senate Democrats for the looming cutoff, faulting lawmakers for not voting on a bill passed by the GOP-controlled House to fund the government. Meanwhile, Democrats have pressed GOP leadership to agree to extend health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown. Annis said she just wants lawmakers to find a solution. \"This should not be a political issue,\" she said. \"This should be a human privilege to be fed.\" Unemployed cancer survivor on food stamps fears lapse of benefits caused by shutdown 02:24 By Caitlin Huey-Burns https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-latest-senate-reconvenes-trump-asia/#post-update-6a0f217e link copied 7:21 PM / October 27, 2025 Democratic states post messages blaming Trump for food stamp cutoff Several Democratic states have posted messages on their online portals for food aid that explicitly blame President Trump or Republicans for an expected halt in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. \"President Trump is currently choosing to not issue November SNAP benefits that help you and many families put food on the table,\" read a message on Massachusetts\u0027 SNAP website. The states of Illinois and Pennsylvania put similar pop-up messages on their SNAP portals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says SNAP benefits — otherwise known as food stamps — will not go out on Saturday, Nov. 1, due to the shutdown, after the Trump administration decided not to tap approximately $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the benefits flowing. The program helps about 1 in 8 Americans pay for groceries. The USDA blamed Democrats for the shortfall. \"Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,\" the USDA site reads. \"Bottom line, the well has run dry.\" By Emma Nicholson https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-latest-senate-reconvenes-trump-asia/#post-update-609b2e3e link copied 6:33 PM / October 27, 2025 Air traffic controller shortages cause delays at Newark, Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin airports Three U.S. airports are facing delays due to low air traffic control staffing levels. Flights at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport are delayed by an average of 39 minutes, with flights out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport delayed 18 minutes, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. The agency said staffing was the cause of the delays at all three airports. Dallas and Newark are among the busiest airports in the country, and serve as hubs for American Airlines and United Airlines, respectively. Air traffic controllers have not received a full paycheck since the government shutdown began earlier this month, but they are expected to report to work without pay — and as in prior shutdowns, the number of staff members who call out sick has increased.

Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, led a group of colleagues on Monday to call on the administration to immediately open up the \"window-shopping\" period before Affordable Care Act open enrollment, which begins Nov. 1. Window-shopping allows consumers to see the cost of plans before open enrollment starts. In a letter to Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, the group of 30 Senate Democrats stressed that window-shopping is \"more important than ever before,\" saying the millions of people who buy health insurance on the ACA marketplace \"need as much time and information as possible to understand and prepare for these significant premium increases.\" \"Now more than ever, working families need to understand the consequences of Republicans\u0027 choice to hand historic tax cuts to billionaires and wealthy corporations while leaving people who buy their own health insurance to fend for themselves,\" the Democrats wrote. Democrats have made an extension of the health insurance tax credits the key pillar of their demands to support the effort to reopen the government, warning that premiums could more than double next year. But Republicans have insisted that they will not negotiate the issue until the shutdown comes to an end. In the letter, the Democrats said that for the last eight years, CMS has given people about one week to preview health coverage options. \"Republican and Democratic administrations have ensured that consumers have the opportunity to review their plan options before open enrollment begins,\" they wrote. \"This Administration has no reason to delay giving Americans this vital information.\" By Kaia Hubbard https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/government-shutdown-latest-senate-reconvenes-trump-asia/#post-update-08cd591a link copied 3:01 PM / October 27, 2025 Senate convenes for speeches ahead of votes on judicial nominations The Senate convened at 3 p.m., with votes on a pair of judicial nominations set for 5:30 p.m. There is no vote on government funding scheduled for Monday.

One option under consideration is to focus on narrower bills this week, including measures to pay air traffic controllers (sponsored by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz) and/or the military (sponsored by GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan). Thousands of air traffic controllers are set to miss their first paycheck tomorrow, while Friday marks the next pay date for troops. A separate bill to pay federal workers who remain on the job failed last week, but could be resurrected if a compromise is reached between the bill\u0027s sponsor, Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, and Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen. Van Hollen introduced a counterproposal that would include furloughed federal workers and contractors.

I\u0027m continuing to work to make sure they\u0027re not,\" Van Hollen said in a statement to CBS News. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has introduced legislation to fund the SNAP program through the shutdown. A companion measure has also been introduced in the House.

Roughly 1.4 million federal employees whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are hunkering down and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday. Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee\u0027s standard rate of pay.\" However, a draft memo from the White House\u0027s Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we\u0027re talking about.\" Read more about retroactive pay here.

Loeffler claimed \"the pain is the point,\" saying the shutdown has stopped 320 local businesses from accessing $170 million in SBA loans for hiring and expansion every day. \"On Day 27, all of that adds up to 6,000 small business loans that have been prevented from receiving upwards of $4 billion in Main Street lending,\" she said.

The USDA has said the funds are only for disaster situations and are not eligible to cover benefits. One in eight Americans depend on SNAP benefits, with 40 million Americans covered. Plata-Nino, who leads the nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that the situation is \"incredibly serious.\" \"The people relying on this benefit are our most vulnerable. For the most part they\u0027re making less than $1,000 a month,\" Plata-Niño said. \"This means that they may not be able to pay their rent, they may not be able to pay childcare, they may not be able to have food on the table for their children when they come home.

During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, which lasted 34 days, the administration was able to utilize appropriated funding to issue benefits ahead of time, Plata-Niño outlined. But the USDA said it won\u0027t release emergency funds to cover the benefits shortfall this time around. Plata-Niño argued \"the Nutrition Act is clear — the secretary has the authority, has the contingency fund that Congress gives her to be able to utilize it at such a time as this, which is the entitlement program so that benefits could be funded and not delayed.\" \"This is a man-made disaster that could be easily avoided,\" Plata-Niño said.

Read Full Bio Frank Andrews October 27, 2025 / 8:46 AM EDT / CBS News The government of Lithuania, which is a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, said Monday that it will start shooting down unidentified balloons that enter the country\u0027s airspace, after a number of them allegedly launched from neighboring Belarus forced the repeated closure of a major airport. Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned Monday that any further balloons detected would be shot down after operations at Vilnius International Airport, which serves the capital city, were halted a total of four times last week. \"Today we have decided to take the strictest measures, there is no other way,\" Ruginiene told journalists, according to Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT, calling the incidents \"hybrid attacks\" and saying her country could discuss invoking the collective defense clause in the founding NATO treaty over the incidents. Article 4 can be invoked by any NATO member that feels its security is at risk, which would spark talks among the allies to discuss the threat. Article 4 has been invoked nine times in NATO\u0027s history, three of which related to Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine. Lithuania believes smugglers use the balloons to transport contraband cigarettes over the border, but it has criticized Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin, for not clamping down. In this undated photo released by the State Border Guard Service of Lithuania, an officer inspects a balloon used to carry cigarettes into the country by suspected Belorussian smugglers. State Border Guard Service via AP \"Inaction is also an action,\" Ruginiene said after a meeting of her country\u0027s National Security Commission on Monday. \"If Belarus does nothing about it and does not fight, we also assess these actions accordingly.\" Ruginiene added that her government would indefinitely close its land border with Belarus, apart from for diplomats and returning European Union nationals, according to LRT. \"This is how we send a signal to Belarus and say that no hybrid attack will be tolerated here, we will take all the strictest measures to stop such attacks,\" she said. \"Our response will determine how far autocrats dare to go,\" Ruginiene\u0027s office said in a statement sent later Monday to CBS News. There was no immediate comment on the incident from officials in Belarus. \"Calculated provocations\" Many of America\u0027s European allies have had their airspace breached in recent weeks, mostly by unclaimed drones sighted around airports and military facilities in Germany, Denmark and the Baltic states. Estonia also accused Russian fighter jets of flying through its airspace for 12 minutes in mid-September. Lithuania\u0027s Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said Monday in a post on social media that NATO was facing a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare from Russia and its proxy, Belarus,\" calling the spate of recent airspace incursions, \"calculated provocations designed to destabilize, distract and test NATO\u0027s resolve.\" He called for further sanctions against Belarus and stronger NATO security measures to deter the airspace violations. On October 23, a Russian Sukhoi SU-30 fighter and an IL-78 tanker plane flew just under half of a mile into Lithuanian territory, according to the country\u0027s ministry of foreign affairs, after departing from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The Baltic Sea coastal territory is separate from the rest of Russia, and bordered on two sides by Lithuania and Poland. Lithuania borders both Belarus and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Encyclopaedia Britannica/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Two days before that, several \"meteorological balloons\" launched from Belarus were detected by Lithuanian radar systems in the country\u0027s airspace, disrupting travel at Vilnius\u0027 airport, the foreign ministry said. Lithuania summoned the top Belorussian diplomat in the country on October 22 to voice a \"strong protest regarding the repeated and increasingly frequent violations\" of its airspace, warning the Russian ally that Vilnius \"reserves the right to take appropriate retaliatory measures.\" Lithuania\u0027s National Crisis Management Center said earlier this month that at least 544 balloons had already entered Lithuanian airspace this year, according to CBS News\u0027 partner network BBC News. The center said 966 such balloon incursions were recorded during 2024. \"Last year we were blind chickens and didn\u0027t see many things,\" Ruginiene said Monday. \"Thank God, there was no catastrophe. We didn\u0027t see certain moving objects, so there were no decisions to close the airspace.\" \"Today we have much better equipment, we can see much more information,\" she said, according to LRT. \"We believe that we need to take action to protect our citizens.\" War in Ukraine More U.S. NATO ally condemns \"escalation of hybrid warfare\" by Russia, Belarus Zelenskyy and his European backers plot steps to up pressure on Putin Ukraine lauds new U.S. sanctions as Russia calls them an \"act of war\" U.S. slaps sanctions on Russian oil companies over Ukraine war Russian strikes kill 6 just hours after Trump-Putin summit plan scrapped In: Belarus War Lithuania Ukraine Russia Drone European Union NATO © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Here\u0027s what to know. Updated on: October 27, 2025 / 7:15 AM EDT / CBS/AP From the depths of Brazil\u0027s Amazon to Indonesia\u0027s rainforests, some of the world\u0027s most isolated peoples are being squeezed by roads, miners and drug traffickers — a crisis unfolding far from public view or effective state protection. A new report by Survival International, a London-based Indigenous rights organization, attempts one of the broadest tallies yet, identifying at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups in 10 countries, primarily in the South American nations sharing the Amazon rainforest. Released Sunday, the report estimates that nearly 65% face threats from logging, about 40% from mining and around 20% from agribusiness. \"These are what I would call silent genocides — there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they\u0027re happening now,\" said Fiona Watson, Survival\u0027s research and advocacy director, who has worked on Indigenous rights for more than three decades. The issue often receives little priority from governments, which critics say see uncontacted peoples as politically marginal because they don\u0027t vote and their territories are often coveted for logging, mining and oil extraction. Public debate is also shaped by stereotypes - some romanticize them as \"lost tribes,\" while others view them as barriers to development. Survival\u0027s research concludes that half of these groups \"could be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act.\" Who the uncontacted peoples are Uncontacted peoples are not \"lost tribes\" frozen in time, Watson said. They are contemporary societies that deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease. \"They don\u0027t need anything from us,\" Watson said. \"They\u0027re happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing — essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\" Survival\u0027s research shows that more than 95% of the world\u0027s uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These communities live by hunting, fishing and small-scale cultivation, maintaining languages and traditions that predate modern nation-states. Why contact can be deadly Groups living in voluntary isolation have \"minimal to no contact with those outside of their own group,\" said Dr. Subhra Bhattacharjee, director general of the Forest Stewardship Council and an Indigenous rights expert based in Bonn, Germany. \"A simple cold that you and I recover from in a week … they could die of that cold.\" Beyond disease, contact can destroy livelihoods and belief systems. International law requires free, prior and informed consent — known as FPIC — before any activity on Indigenous lands. \"But when you have groups living in voluntary isolation, who you cannot get close to without risking their lives, you cannot get FPIC,\" Bhattacharjee said. \"No FPIC means no consent.\" Her organization follows a strict policy: \"No contact, no-go zones,\" she said, arguing that if consent cannot be obtained safely, contact should not occur at all. The Associated Press reported last year on loggers who were killed by bow and arrow after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru\u0027s Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced. Members of the Mashco Piro Indigenous community, a reclusive tribe and one of the world\u0027s most withdrawn, gather on the banks of the Las Piedras river where they have been sighted coming out of the rainforest more frequently in search of food and moving away from the growing presence of loggers, in Monte Salvado, in the Madre de Dios province, Peru, June 27, 2024. Survival International/Handout via REUTERS There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members. In 2018, American John Allen Chau was killed after kayaking to a remote Indian island populated by an isolated tribe known for shooting at outsiders with bows and arrows. How the threats have evolved Watson, who has worked across the Amazon for 35 years, said early threats stemmed from colonization and state-backed infrastructure. During Brazil\u0027s military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, highways were bulldozed through the rainforest \"without due regard\" for the people living there. \"The roads acted as a magnet for settlers,\" she said, describing how loggers and cattle ranchers followed, bringing gunmen and disease that wiped out entire communities. A group known as FENAMAD, which defends the rights of Peru\u0027s Indigenous peoples, says tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes are on the rise and more government protective action is needed. A railway line now planned in Brazil could potentially affect three uncontacted peoples, she said, but the rise of organized crime poses an even greater risk. Across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, drug traffickers and illegal gold miners have moved deep into Indigenous territories. \"Any chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\" she said. \"And bows and arrows are no match for guns.\" Evangelical missionary incursions have also caused outbreaks. Watson recalled how, under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical pastor was placed in charge of the government\u0027s unit for uncontacted peoples and gained access to their coordinates. \"Their mission was to force contact — to \u0027save souls,\u0027\" she said. \"That is incredibly dangerous.\" Ways to protect uncontacted peoples Protecting uncontacted peoples, experts say, will require both stronger laws and a shift in how the world views them — not as relics of the past, but as citizens of the planet whose survival affects everyone\u0027s future. Advocates have several recommendations. First, governments must formally recognize and enforce Indigenous territories, making them off-limits to extractive industries. Mapping is crucial, Bhattacharjee said, because identifying the approximate territories of uncontacted peoples allows governments to protect those areas from loggers or miners. But, she added, it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups\u0027 health or autonomy. Second, corporations and consumers must help stop the flow of money driving destruction. Survival\u0027s report calls for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from Indigenous lands. \"Public opinion and pressure are essential,\" Watson said. \"It\u0027s largely through citizens and the media that so much has already been achieved to recognize uncontacted peoples and their rights.\" Finally, advocates say the world must recognize why their protection matters. Beyond human rights, these communities play an outsized role in stabilizing the global climate. \"With the world under pressure from climate change, we will sink or swim together,\" Bhattacharjee said. Governments\u0027 uneven response International treaties such as the International Labor Organization\u0027s Convention 169 and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirm the right to self-determination and to remain uncontacted if they choose. But enforcement varies widely. In Peru, Congress recently rejected a proposal to create the Yavari-Mirim Indigenous Reserve, a move Indigenous federations said leaves isolated groups exposed to loggers and traffickers. In Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to rebuild protections weakened under Bolsonaro, boosting budgets and patrols. In 2018, footage showed an indigenous man believed to be the last remaining member of an isolated tribe in the Brazilian Amazon. And in Ecuador, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled this year that the government failed to protect the Tagaeri and Taromenane peoples who live in voluntary isolation in Yasuni National Park. Watson warned that political forces tied to agribusiness and evangelical blocs are now working to roll back earlier gains. \"Achievements of the last 20 or 30 years are in danger of being dismantled,\" she said. In July 2024, photos emerged of the uncontacted tribe searching for food on a beach in the Peruvian Amazon. Survival International said at the time the photos and videos posted showed about 53 male Mashco Piro. The group estimated as many as 100 to 150 tribal members would have been in the area with women and children nearby. Members of the Mashco Piro Indigenous community, a reclusive tribe and one of the world\u0027s most withdrawn, gather on the banks of the Las Piedras river where they have been sighted coming out of the rainforest more frequently in search of food and moving away from the growing presence of loggers, in Monte Salvado, in the Madre de Dios province, Peru, June 27, 2024. Survival International/Handout via REUTERS \"This is irrefutable evidence that many Mashco Piro live in this area, which the government has not only failed to protect but actually sold off to logging companies,\" Alfredo Vargas Pio, president of local Indigenous organization FENAMAD, said in a statement at the time. A 2023 report by the United Nations\u0027 special reporter on the rights of Indigenous peoples said Peru\u0027s government had recognized in 2016 that the Mashco Piro and other isolated tribes were using territories that had been opened to logging. The report expressed concern for the overlap, and that the territory of Indigenous peoples hadn\u0027t been marked out \"despite reasonable evidence of their presence since 1999.\" What the new report calls for Survival International\u0027s report urges a global no-contact policy: legal recognition of uncontacted territories, suspension of mining, oil and agribusiness projects in or near those lands and prosecution of crimes against Indigenous groups. Watson said logging remains the biggest single threat, but mining is close behind. She pointed to the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa on Indonesia\u0027s Halmahera Island, where nickel for electric-vehicle batteries is being mined. \"People think electric cars are a green alternative,\" she said, \"but mining companies are operating on the land of uncontacted peoples and posing enormous threats.\" In South America, illegal gold miners in the Yanomami territory of Brazil and Venezuela continue to use mercury to extract gold - contamination that has poisoned rivers and fish. \"The impact is devastating — socially and physically,\" Watson said.

In a statement, police said the narcotics were hidden in the hold of the boat, which was flying a Tanzanian flag and had departed from Panama en route to Vigo, in north-west Spain. The cargo ship, which was approximately 177 feet long, had unusual structures on board which concealed the narcotics, officials said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. federal agency responsible for combating drug trafficking, provided key \"information\" that enabled the operation to succeed, the press release stated. Police released video on social media showing officers on a speed boat intercepting the alleged drug-trafficking ship. Spanish police said Sunday that they seized 6.5 tons of cocaine from a ship off the Canary Islands. Spanish National Police Spain is one of the main gateways for cocaine into Europe, due to its links with Latin America, where the drug is produced, and its geographical location in the southwest of the continent. In June, police forces from multiple countries dismantled a drug trafficking ring that used what authorities called high-speed \"narco boats\" to smuggle large quantities of cocaine from Brazil and Colombia to the Canary Islands. The ring allegedly used an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform for the speedboats. Spanish police made their biggest ever cocaine seizure last October when they discovered some 13 tons hidden in a shipment of bananas to the southern port of Algeciras. Intelligence from Ecuadoran police tipped off the Spanish authorities, national police said at the time. Large amounts of drugs have also been confiscated from boats in other parts of the world recently. Earlier this month, U.S. Central Command confirmed that a Pakistani navy ship seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. Last month, the French navy seized nearly 10 tons of cocaine worth more than $600 million from a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa. In April, the U.S. Coast Guard seized roughly 10,000 pounds of cocaine from a fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean.
